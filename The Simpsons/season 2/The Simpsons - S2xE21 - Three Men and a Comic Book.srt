00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,452
Three Men And A Comic Book

2
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:22,209
Hurry, Mom!
All the good comics will be gone!

3
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:26,332
Good comics?
You only buy Casper the Wimpy Ghost.

4
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,172
Equating friendliness
with wimpiness...

5
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:32,126
...will keep you
from achieving popularity.

6
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,245
I think Casper's the ghost
of Richie Rich.

7
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:38,809
-Hey, they do look alike.
-How did Richie die?

8
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:42,403
Perhaps his materialism
led him to take his life.

9
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,410
Kids, could you lighten up?

10
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:49,368
Now Radioactive Man rules!
He's always saying something cool.

11
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:52,969
-He's no wittier than others.
-Oh, yeah? Look.

12
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:57,405
He knocks a guy into the sun
and says, "Hot enough for you?"

13
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:58,927
I stand corrected.

14
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:02,364
We're here.

15
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:10,567
-Too bad we didn't dress up.
-This looks like a discount for...

16
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:13,169
...Bartman!

17
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,167
-Who are you dressed as?
-I'm Bartman.

18
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:20,490
-Never heard of him, full price.
-Rip-off.

19
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:25,162
Is this on?
Young people of Springfield...

20
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:28,490
...welcome to our
funny-book convention.

21
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:34,165
Thank you for pumping almost $300
into the local economy.

22
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:38,167
Your spirits have imparted a glow
to this old warhorse.

23
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,802
I feel like Radiation Man!

24
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:43,931
That's Radioactive Man, jerk!

25
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,284
I stand corrected.

26
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,412
Have fun and be sure to clear out
by 6 for the Shriners.

27
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,213
Get that punk's name.
No one makes a fool of me.

28
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:57,604
Has anyone turned in
a left Vulcan ear?

29
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:04,247
We've got a utility belt, tricorders,
a light saber.... Sorry, kid.

30
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:13,365
-Hey, Bart-dude.
-Hey, Otto-man. What's that?

31
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,803
My own idea for a comic book.

32
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:19,602
It's about a dude
who drives a school bus by day...

33
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:24,608
...but by night, fights vampires
in a postapocalyptic war zone!

34
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,208
We're going to see Buddy Hodges.

35
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:33,050
The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam.

36
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:39,564
Laramie cigarettes give me the steady
nerves I need to combat evil.

37
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:42,970
Wish I was old enough
to smoke Laramies.

38
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:47,968
Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until
you're 16. Look out!

39
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:52,769
Will Radioactive Man act
in time to save the Earth?

40
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:59,204
You know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like
to remember Dirk Richter...

41
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:04,607
...as Radioactive Man and not
the sordid details of his final years.

42
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,208
So keep the questions tasteful.

43
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:12,368
Now, how about a big welcome
for Buddy "Fallout Boy" Hodges!

44
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:17,282
-Any questions?
-When Radioactive Man got injected...

45
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:21,367
...with shrinking serum,
how come his costume shrinks?

46
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:26,647
Who knows? I did play Rum Tum Tugger
in Cats. Anybody see it?

47
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:30,165
-Fallout Boy!
-Yes, you, the masked boy.

48
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:35,766
Does Dirk Richter's ghost haunt the
bordello where his body was found?

49
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:41,843
Dirk Richter was a beautiful man.
Can't you vultures leave him alone?

50
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:47,604
Hey, Radioactive Man Number 72!

51
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:51,402
It's the imaginary tale
where he marries Larva Girl.

52
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:57,171
Wow, Number 9! That's before
Fallout Boy became his ward.

53
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:59,409
I'll show you something...

54
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:04,807
...if you'll put your grubby
little hands behind your back. Behold.

55
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:10,366
Wow, Radioactive Man Number 1!
I bet it's worth a million bucks.

56
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:14,009
It is, my lad.
But I'll let you have it for 100.

57
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,966
-All I got is 30.
-Then you can't have it.

58
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:21,803
But I must. I never knew why God
put me on this Earth. Now, I know.

59
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:25,523
-To buy that comic book.
-Your emotion is out of place.

60
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:31,011
Did you kids have fun?

61
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:36,771
Yeah. For a dollar, a man sold me
35 Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes.

62
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:41,529
I never knew what Superman saw in her.
Give me Wonder Woman.

63
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:46,966
And that golden lariat.
She can tie me up any time.

64
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:51,123
-Homer!
-Just kidding, Marge.

65
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:56,562
Hey, what does everyone say to dinner
at Krusty Burger? My treat!

66
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:01,847
You really are a sport, Dad, taking us
to a fine restaurant like that.

67
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:05,363
-What are you getting at?
-I need $100 for a comic.

68
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,565
For a comic?
Who drew it, Micha-malangelo?

69
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:13,210
-Dad, I want this more than anything.
-Well, T.S.

70
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:15,608
-Please, Dad.
-No.

71
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:23,765
No! Look, we all know that usually
when you bug me I give in.

72
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:27,409
I'm not mad at you.
Shows you been paying attention.

73
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:30,332
But we all know
I'm not giving you $100.

74
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:33,686
-Now, are you gonna stop bugging me?
-No.

75
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,811
-Are you? Are you? Are you?
-No. No. No.

76
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:39,613
-Okay!
-I win!

77
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:44,091
In your face! Yeah!
How do you like them apples?

78
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,403
Don't gloat, Homer.

79
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:52,404
When I was your age, I wanted a
child-sized electric light bulb oven.

80
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:56,612
I didn't have the money.
So, I went to my sisters.

81
00:06:56,813 --> 00:07:01,125
-We'll give you half our allowance.
-lf you'll be our slave.

82
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,212
-This gives us more free time.
-Let's take up smoking.

83
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:09,486
For months, I worked
while my sisters smoked.

84
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,611
Venus

85
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:16,402
Oh, Venus

86
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:21,329
We want those dress shields
hand-washed and drip-dried.

87
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,366
Because I'd worked for it...

88
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:29,209
...all those light bulb-warmed treats
always tasted extra good.

89
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,603
Maybe a job is the answer.

90
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:36,011
I couldn't ask you to do that.
Maggie and Lisa are a handful--

91
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:40,007
-She means you should get a job.
-Me?

92
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:44,172
Get a job? Were they serious?

93
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:50,081
I didn't realize it, but a part of my
childhood had slipped away, forever.

94
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,608
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing.

95
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:57,802
At that moment, my dad and I were
closer than we've ever--

96
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,363
-Bart! Stop it.
-Sorry.

97
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:07,412
I need some money
A lot of money

98
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:12,686
Empty bottles.
Well, it's practically empty.

99
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:14,765
Here you go, Apu.

100
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:18,091
Shall I apply this to the cost
of a squishy?

101
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,451
-No. I need the dime.
-It is good you're learning a trade.

102
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,410
-Americanize this.
-Okay.

103
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:33,611
All those coins
were worth three cents?

104
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:35,650
Let the good times roll.

105
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,292
This is so humiliating.
I feel like such a geek.

106
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:43,963
-How's it going, Bart?
-Terrible. No one's buying.

107
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:49,566
Maybe you need to play
on their sympathies more. Let's see.

108
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:55,163
Now you look pathetic.

109
00:08:56,373 --> 00:09:01,208
Lemonade sucks. I need a new product.
Let's see.

110
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:05,162
Form a line.
Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear.

111
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:08,763
Hey, Bart, could you give me one
on credit?

112
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:11,441
-Beat it.
-You got a liquor license?

113
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,804
-My dog ate it.
-Gotta have one to sell beer.

114
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:20,173
Writing tickets must make you thirsty.
Have a couple on the house.

115
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:24,964
-Seeing that it's a first offense....
-We can overlook this.

116
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,973
So long, officers.

117
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:30,364
Hey, what's all the--?

118
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:34,532
My beer, my beer, my beautiful beer!

119
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:40,606
The boy is desperate.
He wants money to buy a comic book.

120
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:44,766
A comic book?
Boys never change.

121
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:48,204
-Which one? Nazi Smasher?
-I don't think so.

122
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:53,083
Send him over to my house.
I've got a few chores he could do.

123
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,648
He can mix whitewash, right?

124
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,809
-Mrs. Glick?
-You must be Bert Simpson.

125
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:04,045
Looks like you've got
a strong young back.

126
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:07,083
Do you want something to eat?

127
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:12,566
I've got dried apricots,
almond paste, sauerkraut candy.

128
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:16,368
-No, thanks. Who's that?
-That's my brother, Asa.

129
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:22,205
He was killed in the Great War.
Held a grenade too long.

130
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:27,205
This one's for you Kaiser Bill,
from the boys in D Company:

131
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:31,810
Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob,
and yeah, even Reggie.

132
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:34,772
He ain't so stuck-up once you get to--

133
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,728
Here, have some ribbon candy.
Boys love candy.

134
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,209
-No, thanks.
-Boys love candy!

135
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:48,366
-I'd rather get to work.
-We'll start with yard work.

136
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,968
Then you can have a barley pop.

137
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:56,611
I want you to clear out all the weeds.
You do know which ones are weeds?

138
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:58,764
-All of them?
-Good boy.

139
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:04,766
Now be careful with these.
I'll be inside, watching my stories.

140
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:18,562
-Jack, please. I'm married.
-That must be what's turning me on.

141
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,684
Stop it. Some more.

142
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:25,091
Filthy, but genuinely arousing.

143
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,564
-Finished.
-Merciful heavens, you're bleeding!

144
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,172
I'll get the iodine.

145
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,167
Iodine.

146
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:40,166
-Now don't fidget.
-Listen, lady, you don't have to--

147
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,881
They've never improved on iodine.

148
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:48,282
-Did you make any money?
-No, but I'm in a lot of pain.

149
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:51,565
What you're doing for Mrs. Glick
is very nice.

150
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:55,044
-She doesn't have anybody.
-There's a reason.

151
00:11:56,253 --> 00:12:01,008
The sludge certainly collects around
those downspouts, don't it?

152
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,403
I'll sludge you, you old bat.

153
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:06,969
Today, we wash Beulah.
Do you know what that is?

154
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:10,768
Some old lady thing nobody's heard
about for 50 years?

155
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:13,208
It was my wedding dress.

156
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:18,811
But then, I dyed it black
and it became my mourning dress.

157
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,327
Great story, lady.

158
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:30,602
Last night, I dreamed I held you
in my arms.

159
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:36,411
No, not the iodine.

160
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:41,568
Burn the germs off with a torch.
Amputate my arm. But not the--

161
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:47,883
Well, it's payday. I'll wager you've
been looking forward to this.

162
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:51,165
-Yes, ma'am.
-Here we are, two quarters.

163
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:54,564
-Two quarters?
-You deserve every penny.

164
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:59,369
I've told my girlfriends about you
and they have chores too.

165
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,606
-Two quarters!
-Bart, you didn't say thank you.

166
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:07,766
I can leave without screaming
or saying a bad word.

167
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,483
-But I'm not saying thank you.
-You're welcome.

168
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:18,127
All right, off you go to spend it
on penny whistles and MoonPies.

169
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:23,007
-MoonPies, my butt.
-What's the problem, boy?

170
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:27,365
I busted my hump all week
and all I got was 50 cents.

171
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,009
When I was your age,
50 cents was a lot of money.

172
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:32,481
-Really?
-No.

173
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:36,129
I did everything I could
and I've only got 35 bucks.

174
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:39,206
I'm done working.
Working's for chumps.

175
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:44,083
I'm proud of you. I was twice your age
before I figured that out.

176
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:53,411
-Can I have it for $40?
-40 bucks? Forget it!

177
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:58,562
It's all I've got. I sold seeds.
I visited my aunt in the nursing home.

178
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:03,762
-I fished a dime out of the sewer!
-No way. What do you want?

179
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:06,368
-Can I have it for 35.
-No! Kids.

180
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:10,492
I don't need this.
I've got a master's degree in folklore.

181
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:14,971
Do you have the Carl Yastrzemski
baseball card from 1973?

182
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:20,725
Show me the 30 bucks, because if you
ain't got it, I ain't getting up.

183
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:24,969
Martin, if you, Milhouse and I went
in together...

184
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:30,008
...we could buy a copy of
Radioactive Man Number 1 right now!

185
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,683
-Here you go.
-I don't want it.

186
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:36,772
We've got $100, and we'd like
to buy Radioactive Man.

187
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:40,005
Why don't you just waddle over
and get it?

188
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:42,323
Yes, sir!

189
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,769
Wow. Breathe it in, boys.

190
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:53,411
-This is the stuff dreams are made of.
-It smells like my grandpa.

191
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:58,363
Looks like rain.
We better get this baby home.

192
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:04,445
Looks like you bought more
than you bargained for.

193
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:15,412
My pants, caught on barbed wire!

194
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,884
Good Lord, choke, an A-bomb!

195
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:26,882
Becoming radioactive.

196
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:31,604
From this day forward,
I shall call myself Radioactive Man.

197
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:33,844
So, that's how it happened.

198
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:37,363
I'd have thought an atomic bomb
would kill him.

199
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:41,168
-Now you know better.
-Turn the page, Bart.

200
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:47,762
Careful, careful....

201
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,607
You guys can come read it anytime.

202
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:53,890
-Why not keep it at my house?
-That's crazy.

203
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:57,608
-It's ours as much as it's yours.
-How about this?

204
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:03,604
Each one of us will get it
for two days of the week.

205
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:06,606
Wait a minute,
that still leaves one day.

206
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,650
Yeah, what about that?

207
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:12,482
For that day,
we'll use a random number generator.

208
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,611
I'll take 1 to 3,
Milhouse will have 4 to 6...

209
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:17,969
...and Bart will take 7 to 9.

210
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:22,928
-Wait a minute, what about zero?
-Yeah, what about zero?

211
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:25,403
In the event of a zero...

212
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:30,408
...possession will be determined
by Rock, Scissor, Paper.

213
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:32,564
-Okay.
-Excellent.

214
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:37,170
Well, today being my Saturday,
I guess I'll be taking my comic.

215
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:42,568
Nice try. It almost worked,
but tonight the comic book stays here.

216
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:46,243
-lf the comic book stays, then so do I.
-Me too.

217
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:49,172
Fine.
We'll all stay with the comic book.

218
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,603
It'll be like a sleepover.

219
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:55,368
That's what pals do, right?
Real friendly-like.

220
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,372
-I wanna read it again.
-Nice try.

221
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:08,209
Acids in your hand could damage it.
We want it to last forever...

222
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:12,890
...so the last one alive
can be buried with it.

223
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:17,769
-What do you mean, the last one alive?
-I meant years from now!

224
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:22,009
-Bart, don't push him.
-So you're both against me.

225
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:26,365
Well, nobody makes a sap out of
Bartholomew J. Simpson.

226
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:28,052
-Quit!
-You quit!

227
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:30,569
No, you quit!

228
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,812
Would you boys like some milk
and microwave s'mores?

229
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:41,487
Thank you, Mrs. Simpson.

230
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,765
Sweet dreams, boys.

231
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:03,125
-One more step and you're dead.
-I have to go to the bathroom.

232
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,121
-So do l, but I'm not getting up.
-Hey, what's going on?

233
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:12,361
-Martin was trying to steal our comic.
-Let's tie him up!

234
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:16,363
-Is this how you treat your guests?
-Quiet.

235
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:21,243
-We'll take turns watching him.
-Okay, I'll go first.

236
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:25,731
So that's your little game.
Let Bart get nice and drowsy...

237
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:29,369
...then, when his back's turned:
wham!

238
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:32,207
You're crazy.
I'm telling your mom!

239
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:37,811
-Tell him what we do with squealers.
-It's worse than when you have to pee?

240
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:41,966
-You can't stop me!
-The hell I can't.

241
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:49,967
Homer, it's really coming down.
Could you check on the boys?

242
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:52,722
They're fine.

243
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:03,766
Bart, the comic!

244
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,968
Don't let go of me, Bart!

245
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:13,573
It's not that far to the ground.
The rains probably softened it up.

246
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:19,122
If you hadn't tied me up,
I could be saving the comic.

247
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,164
Shut up! Shut up!

248
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,887
Help me!
I didn't even want the comic!

249
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,887
I wanted Carl Yastrzemski
with the big sideburns!

250
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:56,971
Better come in the house.
You don't wanna get the sniffles.

251
00:19:57,173 --> 00:20:01,769
Now, come on. You can play
your little tie-up game inside.

252
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:06,889
I've got some cocoa on the stove.
Who wants imitation marshmallows.

253
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,886
I'd raise my hand if I could.

254
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,564
It's no use, fellows.

255
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:25,164
Another comic book has returned
to the earth from whence it came.

256
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:28,086
We worked so hard
and now it's all gone.

257
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,167
We ended up with nothing
because we can't share.

258
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:36,372
-What's your point?
-Nothing. It just ticks me off.

259
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:43,163
Well, the world is safe again.

260
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:46,968
But for how long?
