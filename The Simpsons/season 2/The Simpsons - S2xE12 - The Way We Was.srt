1
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:07,406
The Way We Was

2
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,962
Do you have to sit so close?
It'll hurt your eyes.

3
00:00:57,173 --> 00:01:01,246
-It will not.
-Oh, yes, it will.

4
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:04,289
Our next movie is McBain...

5
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:08,566
...a shoot-them-up, splatter-fest
from the Hollywood cookie cutter.

6
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:10,764
Here's a brainless scene.

7
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:14,124
Senator Mendoza is
a respected citizen.

8
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:19,566
Yet you ran his limo off a cliff and
drove a bus through his front door?

9
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:23,243
I have proof that
he's head of a drug cartel!

10
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:27,366
I don't want to hear it, McBain!
You're out of here!

11
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:32,890
That makes two of us.

12
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,890
-All right, McBain!
-Cool!

13
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,243
"That makes two of us."

14
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:40,407
Are we talking about the same movie?

15
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:46,643
McBain was a nonstop roller coaster
of chills, thrills, spills and kills.

16
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:48,884
That chase at the end--

17
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,812
That movie stinks like
your creepy apartment.

18
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:55,688
-Your mother didn't think so.
-Real mature--

19
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:59,852
I love watching the bald guy argue
with the fat tub of lard.

20
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,283
-What gives?
-Dad, do something!

21
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:08,688
All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV
to perform a little surgery!

22
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,527
Looks like you lost the patient, doc.

23
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:16,443
Shut up. Cheap Chinese TV, why'd I
ever buy it? Is that better?

24
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,450
No!

25
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,844
How's this?

26
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:25,446
Oh, no. Okay.
Just everybody remain calm.

27
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,486
If you look close,
you can make them out.

28
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,285
Yeah, I think I can.

29
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:35,802
You're staring at a dot.

30
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:40,643
She's right! She's right!
Oh, how I miss TV!

31
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:43,128
Dear God, give me one channel!

32
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:48,487
It's not the end of the world. Before
we got married, we hardly watched TV.

33
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:49,887
You lie!

34
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:54,086
It's true, Bart.
We used to shoot pool and go dancing.

35
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:55,646
How romantic!

36
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:58,731
And we'd stay at home
and talk, like this.

37
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,446
I ain't loving it.

38
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:06,489
It's hard to picture you at the
crossroads of life. So many questions.

39
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:11,045
-Pick one.
-Okay. How did Dad propose to you?

40
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:14,092
Oh, well....

41
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:20,766
I think we found the reason why you've
been throwing up in the morning.

42
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,050
-Congratulations.
-D'oh!

43
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:28,006
I'd rather tell you a different story.

44
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:32,092
How your father and I first met
and fell in love.

45
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:37,442
We were seniors in high school,
but we'd never met.

46
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,244
Gross.

47
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,972
Hey, Homer, you're late for English!

48
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:13,001
Who needs that? I'm never going
to England. Let's smoke.

49
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:16,569
I'm for equal rights, but do we need
an amendment?

50
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:21,489
Don't you deserve to earn as much
as a man who does the same job?

51
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,645
Not if I have to do
heavy lifting or math.

52
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:27,845
Oh, Marge, you really ought
to read this.

53
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,766
The shop kids are smoking again.

54
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:41,485
-We're late for wood shop!
-Let's go grab a burger.

55
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:43,923
Boy, you don't gain a pound.

56
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:47,483
It's my metabolism.
I'm one of the lucky ones.

57
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:53,450
Well, if it isn't Simpson and Gumble,
Springfield's Cheech and Chong.

58
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:57,043
Three days of detention.
You know where and when.

59
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:59,642
3:00, old building, room 106.

60
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:05,685
I found out that to hire professionals
to do all the jobs of a housewife...

61
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:12,202
...who incidentally is not married
to a house, would cost $48,000 a year.

62
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,687
Right on, sister!

63
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:19,769
The first step is to free ourselves
from these male-imposed shackles!

64
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:22,248
Yeah, mama! Take it off!

65
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:27,368
-I didn't think it'd burn so fast.
-It's the paper.

66
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:33,722
Ms. Bouvier, I am surprised. One day
of detention. You know where and when.

67
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:38,688
-No, I don't. I've never really--
-3:00, old building, room 106.

68
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,448
Hi, Estelle? Will you go
to the prom with me?

69
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:48,611
I wouldn't go if you were
Elliott Gould!

70
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:52,647
-Shot down again.
-Don't worry, it's a big school.

71
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,890
There's gotta be a girl
nobody wants to take.

72
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:58,084
Excuse me, is this room 106?

73
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:02,411
-Hey, who's that?
-I don't know.

74
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,530
-Hey, would you like to go--?
-She's mine!

75
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,611
-So what are you in for?
-I'm a political prisoner.

76
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:40,648
Every day, I show up, act like me
and they slap me in here.

77
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:42,605
Simpson, be quiet!

78
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:46,044
-I haven't seen you in school.
-Okay, Simpson.

79
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:48,642
-What?
-Another day of detention!

80
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,923
-Let's get together.
-Two days!

81
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,765
-What's your name?
-Homer.

82
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,241
-Three days!
-J. Simpson.

83
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,091
-Five!
-It was worth it!

84
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:59,649
Six days! Okay, Simpson,
to the back of the room!

85
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:03,171
-Love at first sight!
-Jailhouse romance.

86
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:08,766
I reached step one. She knew I existed.
The problem was, she didn't care.

87
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,289
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

88
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:15,048
Usually, I have to wrestle
the bucket out of your mitts.

89
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:19,326
-Dad, I'm in love.
-Why don't you grab yourself a beer?

90
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:25,648
-But, Dad, I don't drink--
-Cut the crap! "I collect the cans."

91
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:31,723
Now grab a beer and get me one too.
This girlfriend, is she a real looker?

92
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,089
-A lot on the ball?
-Yeah.

93
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,086
Oh, son, don't overreach!

94
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:42,851
Go for the dented car, the dead-end
job, the less attractive girl!

95
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:46,887
I blame myself. I should've had
this talk a long time ago.

96
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,327
Thanks, Pop.

97
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:53,930
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, l,
J, K, L, M, N, O, P-- S.

98
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,567
I need some guidance, counselor.

99
00:07:56,773 --> 00:08:02,405
Okey-dokey. Good Lord, you should've
come to see me a long time ago.

100
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:06,401
I met this girl, Marge,
and I wanna force her to like me.

101
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,605
That's not the type
of guidance I give.

102
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:13,852
I like to think I do something
helpful for every student.

103
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:18,922
The only advice I can give you is
to share common interests and spend.

104
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,488
What interests does she have?

105
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:25,686
She's active on the forensics team.
They meet in room 219.

106
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:29,812
-Far out!
-Do you have plans after graduation?

107
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:33,892
Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of beer
and stay out all night!

108
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:38,530
I meant career-wise. That nuclear
power plant will be opening soon.

109
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:42,448
It's an outfit that won't
require a college education.

110
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:47,044
Me, in a nuclear power plant.

111
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:49,323
Kaboom!

112
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:54,926
But bringing up a son, even a blind
one, isn't a lifetime occupation.

113
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:59,371
Now, the more you help him,
the more you hurt him.

114
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:03,566
Woe unto Shelbyville, should they
underestimate our strength.

115
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:04,967
Thanks, Artie.

116
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,641
I'd like to sign up for something.

117
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:11,084
-We've an opening on the debate team.
-Arguing?

118
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:15,491
I'll take that, stinkpot!
Just warming up, Mrs. Bloominstein.

119
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:21,046
The topic is "Resolved: The speed
limit should be lowered to 55 mph."

120
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:23,289
Fifty-five? That's ridiculous!

121
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:28,089
Sure, it'll save a few lives,
but millions will be late!

122
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:30,011
Why don't you take "con"?

123
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:40,168
No way.

124
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:43,683
-Our speed limit is an anachronism--
-Ignoramus.

125
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:47,084
-Will you shut up?
-That word you call me--

126
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,245
-Ignoramus?
-It means I'm stupid, doesn't it?

127
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:53,650
-Stupidity is different.
-Not to me.

128
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,282
-Ignoramus.
-You are.

129
00:09:56,493 --> 00:10:01,089
-Would you like to do your rebuttal?
-With pleasure.

130
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,170
Ay, carumba!

131
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:13,002
You may not remember me.
I mooned for rebuttal.

132
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:17,092
-Yes, I remember.
-So you wanna go out with me?

133
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,166
Well, I don't think you're my type.

134
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:25,128
You see, the problem is,
you don't know me. I have references.

135
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:31,044
Just ask Coach Flanagan. And ask
Mr. Seckofsky and Barney Gumble!

136
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:32,925
I don't know.

137
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:39,163
I'm not asking you to like me or let
me touch your goodies. Just be fair.

138
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:43,446
Homer Simpson? Oh, yeah.
Junior varsity shot-putter.

139
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:48,767
I think if he applies himself, trains
real hard, he could go another foot.

140
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:53,967
I had him for four years. Solid "C"
student. Made a lamp last year.

141
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:59,725
He's all things to men and maybe to
a lucky gal. Wanna go to prom with me?

142
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:02,731
-Good God, no!
-Well put.

143
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:05,043
Well, what's the good word?

144
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:10,691
I'm sorry. You seem like a nice guy.
But I really don't have the time.

145
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:13,965
And the forensics championship
is coming up.

146
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:16,363
-So?
-And I tutor part-time.

147
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:20,452
-You tutor? Anyone can be tutored?
-Only in French.

148
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:27,206
French? What a coincidence! Just
the subject I'm having trouble with.

149
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:33,811
-Why, you cagey old dog!
-Great story. Work, damn you, work!

150
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:38,370
Bart! You may be telling this
one day if something breaks.

151
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:45,692
Lost a few. There's plenty
more where that came from.

152
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:50,848
Uh-oh, a zit. No problemo.

153
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,928
The perfect crime.

154
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,689
-Why is there make-out music on?
-It helps me study.

155
00:12:11,893 --> 00:12:16,045
Not me. Shut it off and let's get down
to business.

156
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:24,651
-Crayon.
-Bien!

157
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:28,732
-Fenêtre.
-Bien!

158
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,764
-Femme.
-Très bien.

159
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:34,761
I should be going.
I have a big forensics meet tomorrow.

160
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,089
Wait, wait. Don't go.

161
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,882
Wait. Wait. Why don't we
take a little study break?

162
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,367
-Do the hustle!
-Keep it down!

163
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:50,449
You're amazing. Now you can
conjugate all the regular verbs...

164
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:54,043
...two irregular verbs,
and sing "Alouette."

165
00:12:56,973 --> 00:13:00,443
-Bien.
-I can't believe it. It's sticking.

166
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:05,369
You're telling me new stuff
and minutes later, it's still there.

167
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:08,645
When I see you forming
vowels and continents--

168
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:14,723
-Consonants.
-With your beautiful mouth and teeth--

169
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:17,441
Merci, I guess.

170
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:21,083
Marge, would you go
to the prom with me?

171
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:25,445
You know, Homer, you're like
no one I've ever met before.

172
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:29,885
You're dear and honest and open,
without a trace of pretension.

173
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:34,484
I'll take that as a compliment.
Will you go out with me? Say oui.

174
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:38,083
-Oui.
-This will be the greatest night!

175
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:41,763
I've been saving up,
but I'll spend it all on us!

176
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:44,732
I'll rent a limo!
I'll buy you a corsage!

177
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:50,644
My tux will have the widest lapels
and the highest platform shoes.

178
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:54,243
Maybe I'll wear my hair up.

179
00:13:54,493 --> 00:14:00,329
Wait, Marge. If honest and open is
what you like, get a load of this.

180
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:06,967
I'm not in any French class. This was
a brilliant scheme to get to know you.

181
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:10,404
You knew the City Forensics Finals
are tomorrow...

182
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:14,845
...and you kept me up until 1 a.m.
pretending to be stupid!

183
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:18,648
Homer J. Simpson, I hate you!

184
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:27,248
Hey, Barney. Guess who's
got a date for the prom?!

185
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:34,326
I know this story doesn't end
with you telling it to us.

186
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,690
They married, had kids
and bought a cheap TV.

187
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:43,771
Bringing up a son, even a blind one,
isn't a lifetime occupation.

188
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:47,050
-Now, the more you help him...
-Terrible.

189
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,642
...the more you hurt him.

190
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,091
Congratulations, Artie.

191
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:58,321
This may not be an appropriate forum
for what I'm about to put forth...

192
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:03,089
...but would you go
to the prom with me?

193
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:09,641
I can think of many cogent arguments.
The first is from Time magazine:

194
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:14,449
"America's Affair With the Prom."
"Even wallflowers can date--"

195
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:19,448
The best argument is that I've known
and respected you for eight years.

196
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,848
I'll go to the prom with you.

197
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:30,247
If you pinch your cheeks, they'll
glow. Try to break some capillaries.

198
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:35,607
-Couldn't we just use rouge for this?
-Ladies pinch. Whores use rouge.

199
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:39,121
Is Marge here?

200
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,284
-Who--?
-Or what are you?

201
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:44,525
-I'm her date.
-I suppose you wanna come in.

202
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,850
-Okay.
-Marge's dates always get homelier.

203
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:50,732
That's what you get
when you don't put out.

204
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:57,931
I usually insist on approving Marge's
dates, but you're a solid citizen.

205
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,044
Thanks, Mr. B.

206
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:04,489
Here she comes.
Get the camera ready.

207
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:08,682
Homer?

208
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:16,122
-What are you doing here?
-You said you'd go with me.

209
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:20,161
I said I hated you, and we haven't
talked since then.

210
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,325
I was afraid you'd cancel
so I stayed away...

211
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:28,772
...even though it meant skipping
school and graduating this summer.

212
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:33,888
-I'm Artie, Marge's date for the prom.
-Well, hello.

213
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:37,443
-Well, hello, hello.
-Don't we look handsome?

214
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:40,127
-Indeed we do.
-Come in, young man.

215
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,212
Wait a second.
If he's your date, who are you?

216
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:48,691
I'm a spare. Excuse me.

217
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:53,842
Now that that unpleasantness is over,
let's take a picture of the couple.

218
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:55,532
Say "Cheez Whiz."

219
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:59,732
-Hey, buddy, where's your date?
-She's with him.

220
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,493
I guess you want me to take you home?

221
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:08,882
I paid for this car, tuxedo and the two
dinners! We're going to the prom!

222
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:11,129
Prom, it is.

223
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:21,563
Don't dance too closely, now.
Have a good time.

224
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:26,568
Wait a second, is that a bong? You
have asthma? All right, move along.

225
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,043
I thought you dropped out.

226
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:33,849
-You wish, Dondalinger.
-That's Mr. Dondalinger.

227
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,485
-Steak or chicken?
-Both.

228
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:48,844
-Coming through!
-Barney!

229
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,852
He's bought himself
a decade of detention.

230
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,567
Children, we've tabulated your votes.

231
00:17:57,773 --> 00:18:02,927
The king and queen of Springfield
High School's class of 1974 are...

232
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:06,728
...Artie Ziff and Marge Bouvier.

233
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:13,327
Oh, isn't she great? Hail, Queen Marge!
Long live the queen!

234
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:19,244
Hello, classmates. Instead of voting
for an athletic hero or pretty boy...

235
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:24,328
...you have elected me, your
intellectual superior, as your king.

236
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:30,483
Very well said. Your king and queen
will share their first royal dance.

237
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:35,244
Why do birds suddenly appear?

238
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:40,804
-Every time you're near?
-I've gotta get out of here.

239
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,688
-Homer?
-What?

240
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:54,644
Why are you doing this? Why can't
you accept that I'm here with someone?

241
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:57,566
Because we were meant to be together.

242
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:03,649
Usually when I have a thought, there's
others. Something says yes and no.

243
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,690
This time, it's only yes.

244
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:10,404
How could the only thing I've
ever been sure about be wrong?

245
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:14,364
I don't know, but it is.

246
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:17,891
-Where to now, Romeo?
-Inspiration Point.

247
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,964
I'm only paid to drive.

248
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:28,561
Artie, I don't know. It was a
beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it.

249
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:30,883
-Just this.
-Artie, please.

250
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:36,451
-Come on, kiss me. Please.
-No, really, I mean it! Now stop it!

251
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,052
-I'm sorry, Marge.
-Take me home.

252
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:45,648
It's 1:00. If you wanna keep me,
I'm afraid it's gonna be $45 an hour.

253
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:52,241
-No, it's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk.
-Yeah, why spoil a perfect evening?

254
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:07,250
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
tell anybody about my busy hands.

255
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,650
Not so much for myself,
but I'm so respected...

256
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:14,522
...it would damage the town
to hear it. Good night.

257
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,291
Yeah, right.

258
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:19,963
When Simpson showed up,
it took years off my life.

259
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:22,932
Stop it. She went out
with the good one.

260
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,727
Shut up! I'm over as far as I can go!

261
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:36,848
All right! All right!
I'll walk in the mud!

262
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,006
-Homer?
-Marge?

263
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:42,842
-Yeah. You want a ride?
-Sure.

264
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:47,845
When I got home, I realized
who I should've gone with.

265
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,930
Who? Oh.

266
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:55,048
-Hi, prom date.
-Marge, pour vous.

267
00:20:56,933 --> 00:21:01,165
-Why so glum?
-I got a problem.

268
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:05,651
Once you stop this car,
I'm gonna hug you and kiss you...

269
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:08,009
...and I'll never let you go.

270
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:11,250
And I never have.
