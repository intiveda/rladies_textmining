00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:07,612
Brush With Greatness

2
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:56,725
Live from Mt. Splashmore,
the county's funnest water park...

3
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:01,922
-...it's The Krusty the Clown Show!
-Hey, kids!

4
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:06,209
You know, today's the last day
of our special week...

5
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:09,923
...on location
at fabulous Mt. Splashmore.

6
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:14,888
I just want to say these people have
been super to me and Sideshow Mel.

7
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,566
The food, the grog....

8
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:22,211
They threw a brunch with fresh fruit
and the most delicious melon.

9
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:24,449
The thing I'll miss most...

10
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:28,925
...is those special Mt. Splashmore
water slides, God bless them.

11
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,926
So fun. So many memories.
Excuse me.

12
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,966
It has been a great week,
hasn't it, Lis?

13
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:40,372
Come out and pack this place,
just to show them how grateful I am.

14
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:44,606
I told them you would.
Don't make me a liar!

15
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,407
Okay, kids!
It's time to....

16
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,647
I want to go to Mt. Splashmore

17
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:56,128
Take me, take me
Take me now

18
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,847
Now now now
Now now

19
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,329
Mt. Splashmore
Take me there right now

20
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:06,048
-This is a rather shameless promotion.
-Worked on me.

21
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:11,806
-Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
-No.

22
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:15,801
-Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
-No!

23
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:21,326
-Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
-No!

24
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:24,525
-Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
-No!

25
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:29,204
-Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
-No!

26
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:32,570
If I take you, will you two shut up?

27
00:02:32,813 --> 00:02:34,212
-Yeah!
-Of course!

28
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:37,132
-Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
-Yes!

29
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:41,611
Come on, Homer!
Get the lead out!

30
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:52,405
Homer, that suit doesn't leave much
to the imagination.

31
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:57,524
-Kids, I'm moving the seat back.
-It is back.

32
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,889
Everybody, stick together.

33
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:11,402
We don't want to get separ--
D'oh!

34
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:16,528
Challenge the raging waters of death!
Discover what water's really made of!

35
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:21,329
-H-2-Whoa!
-Whoa!

36
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:25,491
All right!
No line!

37
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:29,243
Ay caramba!

38
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:32,922
Okay.
Turn on the waterworks, babe.

39
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:36,722
Mommy!
I want my mommy!

40
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:40,209
Step aside. Spread out.
Lost kid coming through.

41
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:42,608
Pardon me.
Moving to the front.

42
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:43,922
Nice work, babe.

43
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,811
No, Maggie!
Stay in the shallow end.

44
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:02,244
The hell with this! Slide inspector
coming through! Move to the right.

45
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:06,202
-Move! I'm here for your safety.
-God bless that man!

46
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:19,205
Bitchen.

47
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:27,610
What?
Come on, you stupid tube!

48
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,922
There's a jam in Delta sector.

49
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:34,250
Too big to be human.
Send kids to dislodge it.

50
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,967
Roger.

51
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,372
Can't breathe.
Too many children.

52
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:54,286
Boo! Boo!

53
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:59,366
Witnesses estimate the man's weight
at 400 to 500 pounds.

54
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:03,886
On the lighter side of news,
and I use the term loosely....

55
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:08,171
It's safe!
This was an isolated incident!

56
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:10,005
I understand, Krusty.

57
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:14,764
Isn't that what you said before the
recall of Krusty-Brand Mayonnaise?

58
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:18,529
That question is out of bounds.
Interview's over!

59
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,333
All right, family.
I want the truth.

60
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,928
Don't pull any punches.

61
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:27,324
Am I just a little bit overweight?

62
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,647
Well, am I?

63
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:34,165
Forgive us, but it takes time to
properly sugarcoat a response.

64
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,404
Four hundred thirty seven--

65
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:46,127
Fifty-five?
My God! Three hundred and--

66
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,364
A hundred and fifty?

67
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,691
Oh, my God!
Two hundred and sixty pounds!

68
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:55,805
I'm a big, fat pig!

69
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:58,772
Now, Homer, you do have big bones.

70
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:02,124
Marge, no one gains
30 pounds of bone!

71
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,643
I'm going on a diet!
From now on...

72
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:09,926
...there'll be no pork chop too
succulent, no donut too tasty...

73
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:13,330
...no pizza too laden
with delicious toppings...

74
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:17,526
...to prevent me from reaching
my ideal weight!

75
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:23,769
As God is my witness,
I'll always be hungry again!

76
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,811
D'oh! Shut up!

77
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:32,131
This old attic's kind of spooky,
isn't it?

78
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:33,965
I said, isn't it?

79
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,730
Don't ever do that again!

80
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,048
Okay.

81
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:44,041
Get away from that
and find my athletic equipment!

82
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:48,889
-Homer, I found your weights.
-Oh, the Glutimus Maximizer.

83
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:53,962
-Who's the mop-top with the schnoz?
-That's Ringo Starr.

84
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:55,367
What is this?

85
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:58,571
Your mother must have painted this.

86
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:02,601
I guess she thought he was cute.
What? Hey!

87
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:03,882
What the--?

88
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:05,321
Marge!

89
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:08,331
Don't be jealous.
I was a schoolgirl.

90
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:12,162
-The Beatles were very popular.
-A likely story.

91
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,928
Why did I have to start my diet
on pork chop night?

92
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:21,928
Homer, we've got steamed vegetables
and rice cakes for you.

93
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,802
Wait, I've been setting my drinks
on these things!

94
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:29,130
They're only 35 calories
apiece.

95
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,769
Hello? Hello!

96
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:34,049
Hello, taste?
Where are you?

97
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,132
-Put something on top, for flavor.
-Now you're talking!

98
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:40,046
These paintings are good.

99
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:46,050
I know how fragile young talent is.
Tell me how your gift was squashed.

100
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,806
Well....

101
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:53,411
-Another one of that bongo beater!
-Mr. Schindler--

102
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:57,367
One might've used this canvas
to paint a masterpiece.

103
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,962
Instead, you've soiled it forever.

104
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,046
-Now this is art!
-Thanks, Mr. Schindler.

105
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:08,566
I can't believe you gave up because of
one small-minded art teacher.

106
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:14,086
I sent the portrait to the only man
whose opinion I could trust.

107
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,682
And what was Ringo's response?

108
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,487
I never got any.
I never painted again.

109
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:21,968
Take a class at community college.

110
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:26,126
-What do you think, Homer?
-Do I have to do anything?

111
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,131
-No.
-Great! Fine! Go nuts!

112
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:33,171
Only 35 calories.

113
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,245
-Hello, Mrs. Homer!
-Apu, why are you here?

114
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,523
I enrolled in Screenwriting.

115
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,770
I yearn to tell the story
of a young Hindu...

116
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:48,652
...pushed too far
by Quik-E-Mart bandits:

117
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:52,169
-It's Hands off My Jerky, Turkey.
-Clever title.

118
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:55,285
-Thanks. My brother thought of it.
-Next up.

119
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,327
My mother would like to enroll
in Painting from Life 2B.

120
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,932
Not so fast there.

121
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:05,928
No one can enroll until
Mr. Lombardo approves their portfolio.

122
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,045
-Lisa, this was a bad idea.
-Mom....

123
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:13,603
Very good. Fabulous.

124
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,492
Even better!
You have real talent.

125
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:19,924
You think so?
My art teacher hated them.

126
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,805
What?
The man was a fool!

127
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:25,767
-I admire the force of his conviction.
-I'm in the class?

128
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:30,842
There couldn't be a class without you.
If you'll excuse me, nature calls.

129
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:33,885
Marvelous!

130
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:41,962
-The Heavy Hands only work if you move.
-I can't.

131
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,283
Oh, really?

132
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:49,447
Now, using the Lombardo method...

133
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:54,448
...you learn to see everyday objects
as simple geometrical shapes.

134
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:58,931
Here, we see how two circles,
various trapezoids, ellipses...

135
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:01,289
...and yes, even a rhombus...

136
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:04,405
...can create
an adorable bunny rabbit.

137
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:07,690
It's just that easy!

138
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:15,448
Lincoln, I've been thinking
What have you been drinking?

139
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:20,602
Is it water? Is it wine?
Oh, my gosh, it's turpentine

140
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:34,205
Bravo! Walk away.
Now it belongs to the ages.

141
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:36,728
Not another stroke!
Oh, one more.

142
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:39,003
That's it! Perfect!

143
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:41,572
Indeed.

144
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:45,089
You find the inner beauty
of your subject.

145
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:48,251
-Thank you, professor.
-You're welcome.

146
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:51,053
Marge, walk with me.

147
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:55,167
They want me to submit
a painting from my class...

148
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:57,881
...to the art exhibition next week.

149
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:01,802
I've decided to choose your
Bald Adonis.

150
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:05,528
Really?
I wish every teacher was like you.

151
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:09,169
Marge, please.
I don't take praise very well!

152
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,007
Oh! Another triumph!

153
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:29,052
-I can't believe it!
-Yeah, Mom!

154
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:33,844
I'm a work of art!
Last Supper, eat your heart out.

155
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:37,122
Garbage!

156
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:41,651
What matchbook art school
did you flunk out of, housepainter?

157
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:45,010
-Throw this on the dung heap!
-I quit.

158
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:48,046
Well, I guess that's
artistic temperament.

159
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:52,451
Sir, the dedication of the Burns Wing
of the museum...

160
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,723
-...is six days away.
-Damnation!

161
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:59,888
This is as half-baked
as your idea about me having children.

162
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,492
Find me an artist.

163
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:06,323
You've systematically alienated
Springfield's entire art community.

164
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:09,565
-The only one left is Mrs. Simpson.
-Who?

165
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,965
She's the wife of an employee.
She'll be easily intimidated.

166
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:17,449
Excellent!
Once again, the wheel has turned...

167
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:22,528
...and Dame Fortune has hugged
Montgomery Burns to her sweet bosom.

168
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:25,725
-Somebody up there likes me.
-Down here too.

169
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:27,850
Shut up!

170
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:36,966
D'oh!

171
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,406
D'oh!

172
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,925
Two-forty-nine! Yeah!

173
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,647
Marge! Marge, look at me!

174
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:54,324
-My clothes are hanging off me.
-That's wonderful! Right, kids?

175
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,484
I told you to show support.

176
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,287
-Way to go, Dad!
-You look marvelous!

177
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,972
Oh, what a family.

178
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:04,171
What gives?
These donuts are piling up.

179
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:09,925
-Homer Simpson went on a diet.
-Oh, my God! And I just bought a boat!

180
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:21,124
-Don't people answer the door?
-Allow me.

181
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,208
Open up! Open up!

182
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:27,889
Mr. Burns!
Would you like to come in?

183
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:30,607
He'd like to commission a portrait.

184
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:34,522
-Have you painted the rich?
-No, just Ringo Starr.

185
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:35,768
Ring Go?

186
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:38,527
He was the drummer for the Beatles.

187
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,564
Beatles, eh? Oh, yes.

188
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:45,801
I remember their off-key caterwauling
on the old Sullivan show.

189
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:50,643
This commission and all of its glory
can be yours...

190
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:53,532
...but you must answer one question.

191
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:56,333
-Shoot.
-Can you make me beautiful?

192
00:13:57,173 --> 00:14:00,483
-That won't be a problem.
-I'm no matinee idol.

193
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:05,164
Maybe not, but I have the gift
of seeing inner beauty.

194
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:08,012
Mrs. Simpson, you may immortalize me.

195
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,723
At last, the world will see you
as I always have.

196
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:16,369
Yes. Now don't be stingy
with the blush, Smithers.

197
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:21,852
Now, you, paint!

198
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:26,689
-Honey, I'm home!
-There's an original sentiment.

199
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:29,487
Take it outside. I'm male-modeling.

200
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:33,527
-I'm painting his portrait.
-Isn't that wonderful?

201
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:38,045
My work and my home life,
come together in such a nice way.

202
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:39,851
Marge, may I see you?

203
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:44,524
He thinks he's handsome.
You've gotta make him look handsome!

204
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:50,330
Don't worry. All I need to do
is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty.

205
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:57,529
What were you like as a boy?
Did you have a dog that you loved?

206
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:04,006
-Something's on my leg! Get it off!
-Mr. Burns, she's just a baby!

207
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:09,648
All right, all right.
Who took the funny pages?

208
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:15,450
So Ziggy goes to the repair shop.
There's a sign reading "Out of Order."

209
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:19,163
Oh, Ziggy, will you ever win?

210
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,002
Oh, my.

211
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:26,131
Excuse me!
I'm changing for a meeting!

212
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,568
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.

213
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:32,567
-Did he have spots all over his body?
-I heard that!

214
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,764
Should I leave too, sir?

215
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:38,892
Of course not, Smithers.
You're like a doctor.

216
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,725
Smithers! I want my tea!

217
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:45,050
Doesn't it bother you
that he orders you around?

218
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:47,568
Actually, I value every second.

219
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:51,601
I squeeze his juice each morning.
I tuck him in at night.

220
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:55,089
He's not just my boss.
He's my best friend.

221
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:58,251
-Too hot!
-Right. It's scalding me as we speak.

222
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:06,965
"Dear Sally, in response to
your letter of Dec. 12, 1966...

223
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:11,001
...me favorite color's blue,
and me real name's Richard.

224
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:15,405
Thanks for the snapshot.
You're a real cute bird. Love, Ringo.

225
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,808
PS: Forgive the late reply."

226
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:20,647
-Mr. Starr, tea.
-Set it over there.

227
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:25,449
If you'll forgive me, your devotion
to your fans is remarkable.

228
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:28,042
They took the time to write me.

229
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:33,526
Even if it takes 20 more years,
I'm going to answer every one of them.

230
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,241
Hello!
What's this?

231
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,525
From Springfield, U.S.A.

232
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,802
Gear!

233
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:49,926
-Cease that infernal tootling!
-I was practicing.

234
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:54,604
It's hard to find your beauty
if you're shouting at a little girl.

235
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,362
We've only got two days left.
Shut up and paint!

236
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:01,246
Okay, scale.
We don't like each other...

237
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:04,371
...but I've been good
so treat me right!

238
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:06,524
All right!

239
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:12,168
Marge!
I'm two-thirty-nine and feeling fine

240
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:14,967
I'm using the original notches!

241
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:17,129
That's wonderful, Homer! I'm--

242
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:19,091
Let me get this straight.

243
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:23,684
You're pleased with
your current appearance?

244
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:26,692
You're the fattest thing
I've ever seen...

245
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:29,327
...and I've been on safari.

246
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:33,287
If you need me,
I'll be in the refrigerator.

247
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:39,246
I've had enough of your posing!
I can finish the portrait myself.

248
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:43,128
Another day
and I would've needed a Valium.

249
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:47,844
Thank you for your hospitality.
See you at the unveiling.

250
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,368
What are you doing?
Give me that!

251
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,529
He's right. What's the use?

252
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,964
Don't listen to him!
He's a mean little SOB.

253
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:00,162
Oh, Marge!

254
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:05,731
-I thought there's good in everybody.
-Just paint a nice picture of him.

255
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:07,332
I don't think I can.

256
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:11,765
-Marge, you have to!
-I can't make him beautiful!

257
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:14,243
I guess I'm no artist.

258
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:19,004
Hello. What's this? For you, Marge.
From merry ol' England.

259
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:22,523
-From the desk of Ringo Starr!
-Dear Marge....

260
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,963
Thanks for the fab painting.

261
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:28,125
I hung it on me wall.
You're quite an artist.

262
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:32,326
Yes, we do have hamburgers
and fries in England...

263
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:36,128
...but we call French fries "chips. "
Love, Ringo.

264
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:40,167
PS: Forgive the lateness of my reply.

265
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:43,649
Come on, Marge, paint!
I think you can do it.

266
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:47,249
Okay, Homer.
If you think I can.

267
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:16,410
Friends, art lovers,
security personnel.

268
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:19,770
It's a great day
for the Palace of Fine Arts.

269
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:23,170
A new wing for our museum,
and a portrait...

270
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:26,649
...commemorating the man
who ponied up the dough.

271
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:30,363
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I invite you to behold...

272
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:33,525
...Montgomery Burns?

273
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:37,484
Smithers.

274
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,887
I don't care for this at all.

275
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:55,450
Hello, my name is Marge Simpson
and I painted this.

276
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,202
Maybe you'd like to know
what possessed me.

277
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:04,527
I guess I wanted to show that
beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head...

278
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:08,726
...with its cruel lips,
spiteful tongue and evil brain...

279
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:13,768
...there was a frail, withered body,
perhaps not long for this world...

280
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:19,843
...as vulnerable and beautiful
as any of God's creatures.

281
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:21,972
Yes!

282
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,010
Provocative, but powerful.

283
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:28,523
He's bad, but he'll die.
So I like it.

284
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:32,806
Marge, a word please.

285
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:37,171
You know, I'm no art critic,
but I know what I hate.

286
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:38,926
I don't hate this.

287
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,443
Your painting is bold but beautiful.

288
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:47,408
And incidentally, thanks for not
making fun of my genitalia.

289
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:49,325
I thought I did.
