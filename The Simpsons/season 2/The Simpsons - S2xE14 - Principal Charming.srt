1
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:07,406
Principal Charming

2
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,131
Hey, Homer, did I wake you?

3
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:01,886
I'm up! I'm up!

4
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,966
I wanted to tell you
about a new BBQ joint.

5
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:06,401
Oh, BBQ!

6
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:10,208
It's called Greasy Joe's Bottomless
BBQ Pit.

7
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,448
I can still taste the sauce.
And get this:

8
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:20,211
-It's all-you-can-eat!
-This is like some beautiful dream!

9
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,689
And one and two and
three and reach...

10
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:25,924
...and five and six and--

11
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,806
Marge, I've got five words
to say to you.

12
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:32,204
Greasy Joe's Bottomless BBQ Pit.

13
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:36,201
You promised you'd only have
six servings of pork a week.

14
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:40,247
I'm only human. Now look,
here's what we're gonna do:

15
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:43,803
We'll take the kids to your sisters'
Saturday night.

16
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:46,965
Then we'll eat till they kick us out!

17
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:50,610
Saturday night?
I'm not sure they're available.

18
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:52,127
I'll take that bet.

19
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:59,325
Hello, Marge.

20
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:03,408
Saturday, we're going to
Stanley Peterson's wedding.

21
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:07,322
Although he's going at her
like they're already married.

22
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:10,565
Hey, alley cats.
Save it for the honeymoon!

23
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,567
Well, if you have other plans....

24
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:15,322
It's no problem.

25
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:18,286
We'll leave before they
toss the bouquet.

26
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,687
"F."

27
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:24,330
"L." No, I'm sorry.
That's a "C, " isn't it?

28
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,042
If that was a car,
you'd be dead now.

29
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:31,928
-But driving is my livelihood.
-Take it like a man.

30
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:38,165
Friends, relatives, work-related
acquaintances...

31
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:44,171
...we are gathered here to join
Stanley and Martha in holy matrimony.

32
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:48,844
Martha, my dear, I remember
the first day that I met you.

33
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:54,883
-Hello, Selma.
-Hello, Stanley.

34
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,485
-Is this seat taken?
-Yes!

35
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:00,008
Hey, beat it!

36
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:07,003
Had I not chosen that seat,
Martha, my love...

37
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:11,212
...who knows what woman
I might have ended up with?

38
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,847
Poor Brandy. Aunt Selma?

39
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:30,446
-Will you ever get married?
-I don't know.

40
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,843
-Why? You know somebody?
-No.

41
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:36,409
I'm sure you'd resent my pity,
so I'll hope you're...

42
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:40,811
...one of the statistically small
number of single 40-year-olds...

43
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,402
...who find their fair prince.

44
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:53,646
Patty! Selma! We're home!

45
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:04,248
I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe
is sorry he ever met me!

46
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:06,763
Marge, I need to speak with you.

47
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:15,332
Oh, and that sauce, Barney!
I could have drunk a bowl of it!

48
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:18,406
No, that's just my sister-in-law.

49
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:22,728
I'll get right to it.
I'm getting older and uglier.

50
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:27,410
Please, Marge, help me find a man
before it's too late.

51
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:29,962
Well, I'll try.

52
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:38,048
Do you remember when you made us go
to the Bowler's Hall of Fame...

53
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:42,605
...so you could see that car
shaped like a giant bowling pin?

54
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:45,447
Remember? Who could forget?

55
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:48,651
Then you'll also remember
you owe me a favor...

56
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:52,727
...to be called up whenever
and for whatever reason I desire.

57
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:57,006
-But that was just an idle promise.
-Not to me!

58
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:02,805
-I want you to find Selma a husband.
-Find a husband?!

59
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:04,685
Wait, which one's Selma?

60
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:08,289
She's the one who likes
Police Academy movies...

61
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:11,405
...and walking in
the park on autumn days.

62
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:15,891
I thought she was the one
who didn't like to be touched.

63
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:21,002
Patty chose celibacy but Selma
simply had it thrust upon her.

64
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:25,212
-But Marge--
-Homer, you will find her a man!

65
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,449
-Okay.
-And not just any man!

66
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:32,847
He should be honest and caring
and well-off and handsome!

67
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:36,085
Why should she have a better
husband than you?

68
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:39,808
Sodium tetrasulfate is caustic
and can remove your skin.

69
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,725
Say when.

70
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,605
-When!
-What's this for?

71
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:48,324
It's used in making rayons, film
and as a preservative in fast foods.

72
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:52,009
-It's also a potent herbicide.
-What's a herbicide?

73
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:56,126
-It kills grass.
-Excellent.

74
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:59,044
Must find man.

75
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,249
Must find man.

76
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,486
Must find man.

77
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:17,610
Boy, a good man really
is hard to find!

78
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:24,205
According to my sources,
you are simultaneously planning...

79
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:29,089
...to drop your pencils at 2: 15.
Do so and you will be suspended.

80
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,211
-Who squealed?
-You can't get anything past him.

81
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:33,687
He knows everything.

82
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:37,283
Vandalism fans, hold on to your hats.

83
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:45,483
-He'll never get away with it.
-He just goes too far.

84
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,247
One seafood burrito, Apu.

85
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:58,446
The time has come
for money to change hands.

86
00:06:58,693 --> 00:06:59,887
Oh, sorry.

87
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,811
Say what they will
about our cafeteria...

88
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:23,490
...I still think they're the best
Tater Tots money can buy.

89
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:27,125
Wait a minute...

90
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,644
...that smells like
sodium tetrasulfate...

91
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:34,408
...bonding with chlorophyll.

92
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:46,052
Sweet Lord, it is!

93
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:49,649
Simpson!

94
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,042
Surely you knew that by writing
"Bart" in 40-foot letters...

95
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,090
...you would be caught.

96
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,848
-Maybe it was another Bart.
-There are none!

97
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:06,808
The sheer contempt makes me wish
I could use the board of education.

98
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,048
Call your father.

99
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,330
-Is Homer there?
-Homer who?

100
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,683
Homer Sexual.

101
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,487
Wait one second, let me check.

102
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:22,127
Homer Sexual!

103
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:26,525
Come on, one of you guys
has got to be Homer Sexual!

104
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,525
Don't look at me!

105
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:33,324
You little punk!
If I get ahold of you...

106
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,128
-...I'll rip your face off!
-You'll do what, young man?

107
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,210
What? Wait. Who is this?

108
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,445
The question is, who's this
and where is Homer?

109
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:47,443
Sorry, Principal Skinner.
It's a bad connection, I think.

110
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,412
For you. I think Bart's
in trouble again.

111
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:51,768
What now?

112
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:54,083
The victim is the grass...

113
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,888
...on groundskeeper Willie's
award-winning play field.

114
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:59,606
If it's okay with you...

115
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:04,483
...I'd like to punish Bart through
backbreaking physical labor.

116
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:08,169
Re-sodding the field manually,
seed by seed.

117
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:25,888
But enough about Bart.
Tell me, are you married?

118
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,566
Only to my job.

119
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:31,243
But if you weren't,
you'd tend to go for a girl?

120
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:35,691
These pants come off
at night just like everybody else's.

121
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,003
Why all the questions?

122
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,091
Oh, no reason.

123
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,244
I was just wondering if...

124
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:47,731
...you'd like to come over
to my house for dinner.

125
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:51,488
A payback for all the things
Bart has done!

126
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:56,290
Well, a home-cooked meal would be
a nice change of pace.

127
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:59,366
-I'd be delighted!
-Excellent.

128
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,930
Good evening
and welcome to our home.

129
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:14,765
I only hope we can put our differences
aside for the next few hours.

130
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:16,890
Just get inside already.

131
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:18,802
He's here.

132
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:22,932
What are you waiting for?
Go shake your moneymaker.

133
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:25,482
I'm too nervous. You do it.

134
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,968
-No, you do it.
-No, you do it.

135
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,404
I had a discomforting
thought on the way here.

136
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:35,612
This dinner wouldn't be a plan
to set me up with some...

137
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:39,089
...unmarried relation, would it?
Because I can--

138
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,683
Be still, my foolish heart.

139
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,731
Here we go. Boy meets beast.

140
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:54,085
Allow me to introduce you to
my wife's lovely...

141
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,962
-...and available sister, Selma.
-Hey, tubs, I'm Patty!

142
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:00,044
-What?
-Patty.

143
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:01,965
D'oh! Wrong one.

144
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:07,569
So, Patty, tell me, tell me more
about your trip to Egypt.

145
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:09,246
Nothing more to tell, really.

146
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:12,883
The Nile smells and
the horseflies are huge.

147
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:15,203
Marvelous. Just marvelous.

148
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,969
Well, Selma hated Egypt too.
A camel spit on her.

149
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,448
They can be difficult. Patty...

150
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:26,847
...the Parents Advisory Board asked
that I see Space Mutants Part V.

151
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:29,687
Would you be interested in joining me?

152
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:33,443
-I don't--
-She'd be delighted!

153
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,006
-I'll cancel.
-No.

154
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:36,971
We already had plans.

155
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:41,644
Your first date in 25 years
is more important than playing cards.

156
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,083
I tried to repel him, really.

157
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:46,851
Pack of Lady Laramies.

158
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:49,812
It could easily have been me.
Very easily.

159
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:52,487
Laramie Hi-Tars, hard pack.

160
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:57,448
Here you go. Smoke them in good
health. Any lottery tickets with that?

161
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:59,763
No. All right, five.

162
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:03,722
Stupid Principal Skinner.
You gotta be kidding me.

163
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:08,763
Save your strength, lad. There's a
whole field for you to re-sod yet.

164
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:15,564
Bart, you wouldn't know what sort of
candy your aunt likes, would you?

165
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:18,685
-Cherry cordials, sir.
-Oh, very good.

166
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:24,212
Now then, regarding your punishment,
have you learned your lesson?

167
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:28,691
Have I ever. The thought of doing
wrong makes my stomach turn.

168
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,731
Well, you're free to go.

169
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:34,806
Willie, you can take it from here.
Adiós.

170
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:37,971
You haven't seen the last of Willie!

171
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,562
I don't see why this is necessary.

172
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:49,801
You don't want to show up for your big
date looking like Yosemite Sam.

173
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:53,123
How do I look?

174
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,324
Achingly beautiful.

175
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,882
Cherry cordials. I hope you like them.

176
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:13,245
They're okay.
Let's get this over with.

177
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:17,526
Let's start with the
Springfield Revolving Restaurant.

178
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:21,971
Food tastes better when
you're revolving.

179
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:28,611
-This evening has been disappointing.
-Indeed. Terrible.

180
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,691
Hey! Can we get some service
over here?

181
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,929
I keep asking for water.

182
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:37,808
-Is everything all right?
-Little Jimmy Pearson.

183
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:40,811
-Class of '71, right?
-Principal Skinner.

184
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,251
Get this woman a glass of water!
And tuck in your shirt.

185
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:50,128
Nearly 30
and still working as a busboy!

186
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:54,082
Standardized testing never lies.

187
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,805
I'm not surprised.
She's always the lucky one.

188
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:02,490
Two minutes younger. Skin like a
china doll. Bosoms till Tuesday.

189
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:07,403
Don't worry. There are plenty
of fish in the sea. Right, Homer?

190
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:11,811
Oh, yes. Plenty of fish.
We just don't have any bait.

191
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,449
Don't be stupid!

192
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:26,847
Sorry.

193
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:31,405
Oh, come on, love, loosen up.

194
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:37,563
I can't forget what happened to that
poor dingo. What could've done it?

195
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:42,289
It was probably just a wallaby.
Now come on.

196
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:45,730
Well, okay.

197
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,489
Hello, Dolly.

198
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,850
Oh, that was the worst movie
I've ever seen.

199
00:14:57,093 --> 00:15:01,132
Not as bad as the service
at the revolving restaurant.

200
00:15:02,573 --> 00:15:05,963
Isn't it nice we hate the same things?

201
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:12,568
-So, see me again tomorrow?
-That's my microwave cookery class.

202
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:16,767
-Then the day after that.
-Oh, gee, tae kwon do.

203
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:19,885
-The day after that?
-You're touching me.

204
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:23,131
Kiss me, Patty.
I don't have cooties.

205
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:31,966
Thursday, I'm going food shopping.
You can come if you like.

206
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:33,722
Until then.

207
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:38,649
I want every detail.
Or is your tongue too tired?

208
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:42,681
The movie was awful
and he didn't get anything.

209
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:45,527
Now good night.

210
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:14,884
One kiss. But I don't want
you bragging to your friends.

211
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:33,209
Oh, I wish I could make a P.A.
announcement to the whole world.

212
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:36,644
Attention! Seymour Skinner is in love!

213
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:39,811
-That's cool.
-Skinner's gonna kill you!

214
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:43,011
-Skinner? He works for me now.
-Simpson?

215
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:45,370
What is that there?

216
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,891
Patty.

217
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:58,290
I hate to pull you away from
your exercise...

218
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,007
...but I wanted you
to be first to know.

219
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:05,570
-I plan to ask your aunt to marry me.
-Your funeral.

220
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:10,132
Homer, lighten up. You're making
happy hour bitterly ironic.

221
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:16,048
I gotta find a date for my big, fat,
snotty sister-in-law, Selma.

222
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:18,926
I'm intrigued.
What does she look like?

223
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:23,803
-Like my wife's ugly sister.
-Wheel her in, Homer. I'm not picky.

224
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:30,805
-The rule of thumb is 2 years' salary.
-I can't afford that!

225
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:32,447
I'll take it.

226
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:36,169
My sister's not going out
with Barney Gumble!

227
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:39,285
She's no prize pig herself, you know!

228
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:44,001
-Bart, come cheer up your Aunt Selma.
-Okay.

229
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:46,450
What did you learn in school?

230
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:50,202
Principal Skinner's gonna ask
Patty to marry him.

231
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:54,845
Thanks, kid. You made my day.

232
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:59,171
But nothing! She's a heifer,
plain and simple--

233
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,246
There's the little prom queen now.

234
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:07,208
Can the sweet talk! You're right.
It's time to end my girlish dreams...

235
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:10,803
...and grab hold of the next train
out of the station.

236
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:22,132
Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding!

237
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,008
-Oh, shut up.
-Why are you all dolled up?

238
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:29,967
It takes a ripe piece of cheese
to catch the mouse.

239
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:33,486
It's time to give away my love
like cheap wine.

240
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,564
Take it to the hoop, Selma.

241
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:38,082
Hey! Look what I brought!

242
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,484
-Schnapps?
-I'll take that.

243
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:47,409
You seem preoccupied,
my little pudding cup.

244
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:50,725
My sister's on a date
with a big, fat rummy.

245
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:54,887
There's something up here that will
pick up your spirits.

246
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,488
"Marry me, Patty"?

247
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:04,930
Jeezum Crow!
Look at the size of that rock!

248
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:07,846
The second most precious jewel here.

249
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,288
Patty, will you marry me?

250
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:15,288
-I don't know. I mean--
-Just say whatever's in your heart.

251
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,642
It's not that I don't love you.

252
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,605
You love me!

253
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:24,882
-Yes. Yes, but--
-But?

254
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:27,846
But I'm a twin, and as such I have a--

255
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:29,884
Special tie to your sister!

256
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:32,527
Any man I could marry
would have to--

257
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:35,964
Understand that you couldn't
leave Selma.

258
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:39,688
Yes. So I know you appreciate
why you can never....

259
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:42,248
-See you again?
-Exactly.

260
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:46,332
It's kind of a Catch-22.

261
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,722
Farewell, my Patty-cake.

262
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,409
Good night, sweet principal.

263
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:20,685
Oh, Springfield Elementary,
I will have you back again!

264
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:25,927
After all, tomorrow
is another school day!

265
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:30,206
And then when I got
out of the service....

266
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,845
Well, the next few years are a blur.

267
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:36,721
Where's Skinner?

268
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:41,324
We decided we loved each other
enough never to see each other again.

269
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,969
I hope I can find a man like that.

270
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:47,926
Are you throwing away
happiness for me?

271
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,522
-Yes.
-Thanks.

272
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:55,011
-Now let's go get some pancakes.
-Listen, Barney....

273
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:59,248
She broke my heart, Moe.

274
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:03,492
Don't worry, Barney.
Time heals all wounds.

275
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:05,763
What do you know? You're right.

276
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,363
And look, a whole pitcher to myself.

277
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:20,611
I told you you'd be back!
