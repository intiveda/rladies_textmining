1
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:09,926
Dead Putting Society

2
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:28,611
Bust my hump all week. Stupid grass!
Supposed to be the boy's job.

3
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:32,368
Now, Homer, Bart's working
on his science project.

4
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:37,164
You heard the lady, Homer.
So please mow quietly. Genius at work.

5
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,287
One o'clock. Still just a potato.

6
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:48,048
Hey, neighbor. The Lord's
given us a beautiful day, huh?

7
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:49,282
Hi, Flanders.

8
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:52,889
-Doing yard work?
-Who told? Marge, beer me.

9
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:56,523
Say, Simpson, I've got
some time-release granules...

10
00:01:56,733 --> 00:02:00,089
...that'll get rid
of that crabgrass in half a jiff.

11
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,962
Crabgrass?
What are you talking about? Where?

12
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:07,802
There, there,
and there's a big patch over there.

13
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:12,251
There's nothing wrong with crabgrass.
It just has a bad name.

14
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:15,803
Everyone would love it
if it was called "elfgrass."

15
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,408
-You may be right.
-Where's my Duff?

16
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:22,362
We're all out.
Would you like fruit juice?

17
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:26,566
-Don't toy with me, woman.
-Couldn't help overhearing.

18
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,249
I've got suds in the rumpus room,
if you'll join me.

19
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:34,771
Okay, what the heck.
I've earned a little break.

20
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:40,207
Holy moly, it's beautiful!

21
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,763
This is your first visit
to our homestead, eh?

22
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:48,569
We've only been neighbors for one,
two, three, four-- Eight years.

23
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:52,089
There's my little popcorn ball.
Kissy, kissy.

24
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:57,043
Hello, sponge cake. In case you're
hungry, I made club sandwiches.

25
00:02:57,773 --> 00:03:01,004
-Ain't she wonderful?
-Forgetting something?

26
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:06,008
Your beer. Is draft okay?
Just put in the tap last week.

27
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:13,973
-This is a tasty lager from Holland.
-Beggars can't be choosey.

28
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:19,968
Dad, thanks for helping me
with my science project.

29
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,367
Sure, study buddy.

30
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:26,601
-I've got the best dad in the world.
-Now you know how that embarrasses me.

31
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:29,413
I know. Toodley doodley.

32
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:33,009
-Kids can be a trial sometimes.
-Knock it off!

33
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,652
Knock what off?

34
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:39,762
You've rubbed it in the whole time.
Your family is better than my family.

35
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:44,370
Your beer is from farther away.
You and your son like each other.

36
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:49,164
Your wife's butt is higher
than my wife's butt. You make me sick.

37
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:54,203
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave. I hope you understand.

38
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:57,172
I wouldn't stay on a bet!

39
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:00,971
One for the road.

40
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,364
Homie, quit tossing.

41
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:11,885
Sorry, Marge. I'm just steamed up
about that jerk Flanders.

42
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:16,251
-Lousy bragging know-it-all showoff.
-What did he say?

43
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:20,805
Get this.
He said that-- He said....

44
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,362
Well, it was how he said it.

45
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,252
-How did he say it?
-He....

46
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:27,642
-Was he angry?
-No.

47
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,566
-Rude?
-It wasn't how he said it either...

48
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:34,368
...but the message was loud and clear.
Our family stinks.

49
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:37,167
I'm your best friend,
but I've gotta say...

50
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:40,171
...he's always been
a perfect neighbor.

51
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:45,163
-He's perfect now, is he?
-He's not perfect, but he is nice.

52
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:48,485
Don't backpedal. You were right.

53
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,770
He's perfect. Perfect in every way.

54
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:55,283
I'm just gonna walk
around the block to calm down.

55
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,969
I'm not perfect, like Ned Flanders.

56
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:11,487
Neddie, you're tossing.
What's the matter?

57
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:16,284
I feel awful. I forget that
we have it better than the Simpsons.

58
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:20,765
I drag him over, he has a beer.
Can't blame him for erupting.

59
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:26,167
Then I turn into a snarling beast. I
flunked the turn-the-other-cheek test.

60
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:31,248
-Maybe I'm not who you should talk to.
-You're right.

61
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:40,562
-Hello, Reverend Lovejoy?
-This is Mrs. Lovejoy. Just a minute.

62
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,043
Honey, honey, wake up.

63
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:48,242
-Ned Flanders is having a crisis.
-Probably stepped on a worm.

64
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:50,962
Hello, Ned.

65
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:55,764
I'm sorry to bother you, but I threw
a man out of my house today.

66
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,652
I feel like I've violated
Matthew 19: 19.

67
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,963
-Huh?
-"Love thy neighbor."

68
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:04,688
Oh, Matthew 19: 19, yeah, right.

69
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:09,643
Ned, the Good Book says
a gentle answer turneth away wrath.

70
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:12,407
That is a jim-dandy idea!

71
00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:14,723
Bless you, Reverend.

72
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:19,087
"Dear Neighbor...."

73
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:23,968
Flanders!

74
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:26,647
I don't blame you for being upset.

75
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:30,090
I just wanted to give you this.
I'll leave now.

76
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,164
"Dear Neighbor...."

77
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:40,970
"You are my brother. I love you.

78
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:47,731
And yet I feel a great sadness
in my bosom."

79
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:54,282
"Bosom." Wait, wait, there's more.

80
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:58,162
That's awful. He opens his heart,
and you laugh at him.

81
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:05,852
"Neighbors forever." Oh, no.
"Ned Flanders."

82
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:10,242
-What a sap.
-Read the bosom part again, Dad.

83
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:14,487
-Now, just a minute.
-Bosom.

84
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,047
Bart!

85
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,761
I wish we were as close as
the Flanders.

86
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:25,370
Okay, she's right.
Let's do something together.

87
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:30,767
How about some miniature golf,
followed by frosty milkshakes?

88
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:34,010
-All right!
-I was going to wash my hair.

89
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,565
I'm studying for the math fair.
If I win, I'll get a protractor.

90
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,611
Too bad we don't live on a farm.
Let's go.

91
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:47,892
Fore!

92
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:57,241
But I got it in the middle.

93
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,362
-D'oh! That was practice.
-Play it where it lays.

94
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:23,173
There's Homer Simpson. What a perfect
opportunity to follow up on my letter.

95
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:28,883
-Give up, there's a six-stroke limit.
-I can still make this for five.

96
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,170
Come on, baby,
please, please go in. Please!

97
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:42,643
-Hi, Simpson, having fun?
-What are you doing here?

98
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,043
Mini-golfing with Todd-meister.

99
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:46,567
-Hi, Bart!
-Get bent.

100
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:49,486
Since we're friends,
how about a foursome?

101
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:50,961
-Okay.
-Great....

102
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:54,051
Fun. You looked like
you had some trouble.

103
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,365
Jack Nicholson couldn't make
that shot.

104
00:08:57,613 --> 00:09:01,572
It is difficult. The best strategy
is to play conservatively.

105
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:05,806
Hug the rail. It won't go in,
but you set up an easy deuce.

106
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,571
-It went in.
-Good shot.

107
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:11,762
Luck.

108
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:15,363
Final score: Bart, 41. Homer....

109
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:18,565
Six plus six, plus six,
plus six, plus six--

110
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,252
-Never mind.
-Look!

111
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:25,851
-"First prize, $50."
-"Balloons for everyone who enters."

112
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:28,084
Bartley, thinking of entering?

113
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,769
He's entering, and he's gonna win.
Aren't you, boy?

114
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,162
It's possible.

115
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:37,850
I like that confidence but don't
pressure him. Todd's very good.

116
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:43,770
Yeah? The fruit of my loins can beat
the fruit of your loins any day.

117
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:45,372
Come on, boy.

118
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,086
Dad, I've never won anything
in my life.

119
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:55,249
This is the only time I will ever
say this. It is not okay to lose.

120
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:02,162
Stay, stay. Good dog.

121
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:06,042
Keep your head down.
Not you, I'm talking to the boy.

122
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:09,569
Keep your head down. Follow through.

123
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:15,291
That didn't work, so move
your head and don't follow through.

124
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:24,047
Hey! That putter is to you
what a bat is to a baseball player...

125
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:28,286
...what a violin is to the guy--
The violin guy.

126
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,093
-Now give your putter a name.
-What?

127
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,166
-Give it a name.
-Mr. Putter.

128
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:36,045
Wanna try a little harder?

129
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:38,853
-Give it a girl's name.
-Mom.

130
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:40,367
It's Charlene.

131
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:43,252
-Why?
-It just is, that's why.

132
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:46,963
This is a picture of your enemy,
Todd Flanders.

133
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:50,404
Every day spend 15 minutes
staring at it...

134
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:53,372
...concentrating on how much
you hate him...

135
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:57,805
...and how glorious it will be
when you and Charlene destroy him.

136
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:00,362
-Who?
-I'll show you who she is.

137
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:01,972
Now start hating.

138
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:09,772
Hi, Bart.

139
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:16,571
-I overheard you warping Bart's mind.
-And?

140
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:20,488
Aren't you making too big a deal
of this tournament?

141
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,964
But this is our chance
to show up the Flanderses.

142
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,368
Sure, but why do we want that?

143
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:31,044
Sometimes the only way to feel good
is to make someone feel bad...

144
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:34,968
...and I'm tired of making people
feel good.

145
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,371
Hi. What are you doing?

146
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:45,366
Who are those guys in chess
that don't matter?

147
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:50,084
A blockaded bishop is of little value,
but I think you mean a pawn.

148
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,164
Right. I am a pawn.

149
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:55,211
It's times like this
that I'm thankful...

150
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:58,564
...Dad has almost no interest
in everything I do.

151
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:00,769
Bart, I think I can help you.

152
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,731
We begin at the library.

153
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:05,888
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hi, Mrs. Norton.

154
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,964
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey, Ralph.

155
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:10,363
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey, gang.

156
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:15,363
Bart, this is the card catalog.
Let's see. "Golf."

157
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:20,368
"Anecdotes, "Eisenhower and, "
"Humor, "Japanese Obsession With"....

158
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,212
Here it is: Putting.

159
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:28,404
And the most important book of all,
the Tao Te Ching by Lao-tzu.

160
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:32,043
-We can't afford all this.
-We're just borrowing them.

161
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,011
Oh. Gotcha.

162
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:38,246
-Close the logical part of your mind.
-Okay.

163
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:40,484
-Embrace nothingness.
-Sure.

164
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,201
-Become like uncarved stone.
-Done.

165
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:46,286
-You're pretending to understand me.
-True.

166
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,967
-It's very frustrating.
-I'll bet.

167
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:53,764
I have a riddle for you.
What's the sound of one hand clapping?

168
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,571
Piece of cake.

169
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,651
It's a 3000-year-old riddle
with no answer.

170
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:01,043
It's supposed to clear
your mind.

171
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:04,171
No answer? Lisa, listen up.

172
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:11,005
Try another one. If a tree falls and
no one's around, does it make a sound?

173
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:12,766
Absolutely.

174
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:19,568
But, Bart, how can sound exist
if there's no one there to hear it?

175
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:23,769
It is time.

176
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:29,770
The basis of this game is simple
geometry. Just hit the ball here.

177
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:39,842
You've actually found
a practical use for geometry!

178
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:00,648
What is this?

179
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:04,169
-Get down before the neighbors see--
-Simpson!

180
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:08,804
I don't care how this looks. He's
gonna mop up with your son's butt.

181
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:10,884
May the best man win.

182
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:14,443
"May the best man win."
The loser's mating call.

183
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:17,685
Just a minute.
My son has a very good chance.

184
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:21,084
-Yeah? Wanna bet?
-I'm not a betting man.

185
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:25,004
-I'm a chicken, am I?
-Right.

186
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:29,883
How's this? A batch of your wife's
delicious blueberry muffins...

187
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:33,170
...against one of my wife's
homemade wind chimes.

188
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:37,770
-Are you afraid to make a real bet?
-No, I just--

189
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:42,962
-Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.
-How about this, Henny Penny?

190
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:46,410
If Bart wins tomorrow,
you have to mow my lawn.

191
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:52,649
And if Todd wins, you have to mow
my lawn! And do a decent job for once.

192
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:57,603
Better yet, you have to mow my lawn
in your wife's Sunday dress!

193
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:01,812
You have yourself a bet,
you jackaninny!

194
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:06,843
-Read that back to me.
-"The father of the loser--"

195
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:12,042
"Loser" is such a harsh word.
How about "the boy who doesn't win"?

196
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,612
Oh, man. Fine.

197
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:17,687
"The father of the boy who doesn't win
has to mow the lawn...

198
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,844
...in his wife's Sunday dress."

199
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:23,768
You both have to sign?
I hope blood isn't necessary.

200
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:26,766
I'm game if you are, Flanders.

201
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:31,370
Good gravy, what did I do?

202
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:34,366
Straighten your arm.
Rotate your shoulders.

203
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:35,562
Dad!

204
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:38,810
Son, all I'm asking is that you try.

205
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:40,202
I'll try.

206
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:43,883
Anybody can try. I want you to win!

207
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:53,682
Homer?

208
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:58,484
Marge, give me your honest opinion.
This, or this?

209
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:16,969
Morning! By the way, the tournament
is today. And you'd better win.

210
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:19,886
-Dad!
-See you downstairs, boy.

211
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:27,567
-That crazy Marmaduke.
-Eight hole?

212
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:29,968
-Octopus, third tentacle.
-Twelfth?

213
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,765
-Off the grave.
-Nirvana?

214
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:33,810
Bliss from oblivion of self.

215
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:37,204
Here you go.
A lumberjack's meal for my golfer.

216
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:40,889
Mom, Bart is on a diet
of complex carbohydrates.

217
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,887
-Steak will make him logy.
-What won't make him logy?

218
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,486
-Oatmeal.
-Oatmeal?

219
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:51,011
A racehorse eats oats before he
or she wins the Kentucky Derby.

220
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:55,610
News flash, Lisa. Bart is not a horse.
Eat your steak, boy.

221
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,493
Good afternoon.
Welcome to the finale...

222
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,566
...of a stirring afternoon
of miniature golf.

223
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,964
The cream has risen,
the wheat has bid farewell...

224
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:20,449
...and we begin the final match
with two warriors:

225
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:23,526
The unknown Bart Simpson
and Todd Flanders...

226
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:27,089
...one of the most skilled
10-year-olds to ever play.

227
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:32,168
Having never received encouragement,
I'm not sure how it should sound.

228
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:36,008
-But here goes. I believe in you.
-Thanks, man.

229
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:39,689
-Lord, we beseech thee--
-It's no use praying.

230
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,766
I already prayed,
and we can't both win.

231
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:46,210
Simpson, we were praying
that no one gets hurt.

232
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:51,083
Flanders, it doesn't matter.
Tomorrow you'll be in high heels.

233
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,801
-No, you will.
-Afraid not.

234
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,044
Afraid so, infinity plus one.

235
00:17:56,973 --> 00:18:01,171
Young Flanders has the honor
and will tee off first.

236
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:08,012
It's got a chance. Yes, sir.

237
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:14,010
Tree falling in the woods. Tree
falling in the woods. Tree falling....

238
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:23,006
And the battle is well
and truly joined.

239
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:25,005
Mercy's for the weak, Todd.

240
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:57,085
If one looked up "courage",one might
find a photo of these two gladiators.

241
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,804
Near the Great Emancipator at
the last hole, each has eight strokes.

242
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:08,447
The victor shall drink champagne while
his opponent tastes bitter defeat.

243
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:18,362
It's okay, son. You can recover.

244
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:24,802
Remember what Vince Lombardi said!
"Lose, and you're out of the family."

245
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:41,322
Neither in best form. This pressure
can unhinge the steeliest competitor.

246
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,289
-This is intense, isn't it?
-My knees are shaking...

247
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:50,765
...I got butterflies in my stomach.
But it builds character.

248
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,443
-Who wants character? Let's quit.
-Okay.

249
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,565
-We decided we're equally good.
-We want to call a draw, man.

250
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:06,571
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw.

251
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:11,364
Forgive this Brit for crying, but
this is the most stirring display...

252
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:15,686
...of gallantry since Mountbatten
gave India back to the Punjabs.

253
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,447
-Put it there, man.
-All right!

254
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,850
Homer, our kids showed us
something today, huh?

255
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,971
By working together,
we can both be winners...

256
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:30,971
...and neither of us
has to do that wager.

257
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:34,091
-Put it there.
-You're welching on our bet?

258
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,369
What? Neither boy lost.

259
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:39,565
"The father of the boy
who doesn't win...

260
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:43,083
...has to mow the lawn
in his wife's Sunday dress."

261
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,450
But neither-- We--
You have to do it too.

262
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:49,332
Small price to see you humiliated.

263
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,046
My best dress.

264
00:20:57,293 --> 00:21:00,490
One day I'll be telling this
to a psychiatrist.

265
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:04,567
Listen to them laughing.
This is so humiliating.

266
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:07,970
I'm never gonna live this down.
Damn Flanders.

267
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:11,762
Simpson, I feel silly,
but what the hay?

268
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:14,686
Reminds me of my old fraternity days.

269
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,606
Oh, my God. He's enjoying it!

270
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:07,166
Shh!
