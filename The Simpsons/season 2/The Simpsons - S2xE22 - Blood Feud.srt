1
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:07,567
Blood Feud

2
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:21,842
Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee,
distinguished guests...

3
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:25,210
...I'm pleased to dedicate this
warning system.

4
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:28,086
In the off-chance of
a nuclear disaster...

5
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:32,923
...this sign will tell the good
citizens of Springfield what to do.

6
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:46,008
Joke's on them.

7
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:50,804
If the core explodes, there won't
be any power to light that sign.

8
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:55,886
I'd like to present the man
who made this sign possible...

9
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:59,290
...by dropping his obstructionist
legal challenges...

10
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:01,404
...Montgomery Burns.

11
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:06,646
He's never late. Something's wrong.

12
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,727
Nobody leaves
"Diamond Joe" Quimby holding the bag!

13
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:13,882
Must turn over.

14
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:17,012
Got to greet dignitaries.

15
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:21,047
-Oh, no! We've got to get a doctor!
-Absolutely not!

16
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:25,730
No quack sawbones is going
to apply his leeches to me.

17
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:30,205
As long as there's an ounce
of strength left in me....

18
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:36,730
He's suffering from
what we call hypohemia.

19
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,089
It's a lack of blood.

20
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,167
Damn it, I know what it is!
What can we do about it?

21
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,770
-Our only hope is a transfusion.
-How long to sterilize a needle?

22
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:49,201
-Seconds.
-Skip it.

23
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,206
Just leave me enough to get home.

24
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,609
It's not that simple.

25
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,890
His blood is double O-negative.
It's rare.

26
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,846
I'm B-positive.
Damn this gutter blood!

27
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:03,044
Smithers, don't feel so bad.

28
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:08,008
After all, that kidney you
donated to me really hit the spot.

29
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,450
Attention, all employees.

30
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:13,605
Our boss and inspiration,
Mr. Burns...

31
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:16,526
...is at death's door.

32
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:22,241
If you have double O-negative blood,
please report to the bloodmobile.

33
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,647
That is all.

34
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:26,242
-I'd give, except for one thing.
-What?

35
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:27,806
I don't wanna.

36
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:30,244
I can't believe you guys.

37
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:34,406
There's a wealthy human being
who needs our help.

38
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,410
You don't wanna cash in?

39
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:40,083
That's why you losers are
stuck in this crummy job.

40
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:42,523
-I'm your supervisor.
-Sorry, sir.

41
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,610
Maggie, look. What's that?

42
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:47,008
Lemur. Lemur.

43
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:50,649
Zebu. Zebu.

44
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:54,568
-What are you doing?
-Teaching Maggie about nature.

45
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,367
She needs the advantages
I didn't have.

46
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:00,849
Lisa, we did the best we
could. What's a zebu?

47
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:03,442
An ox with a
hump and a dewlap.

48
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:06,929
Hump and dewlap.
Hump and dewlap.

49
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,601
-What's my blood type?
-A-positive.

50
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:12,373
Nuts! Rare blood
and I don't have it.

51
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:15,212
You know his blood type?
How romantic!

52
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,244
A mother knows everything.

53
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:19,211
-My shoe size?
-4-B.

54
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:21,324
-How many teeth do I have?
-Sixteen.

55
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:25,013
-Ring?
-Don't wear them. But three.

56
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:27,244
-Allergies?
-Butterscotch.

57
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:28,369
And?

58
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:30,609
-Monster makeup.
-Impressive.

59
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:34,647
-How many hairs on my head?
-Homie, you have lots of hair.

60
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:38,408
-Why do you need your blood type?
-Burns may die.

61
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,923
He needs double O-negative
blood. No one has it.

62
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,329
-Bart does.
-Yes! All right!

63
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:48,248
Congratulations!
You've got a date with a needle!

64
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:51,644
I don't have to give blood.
I have rights.

65
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:56,131
-Yeah, the right to remain silent.
-You must help those in need.

66
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,972
-It's the only decent thing to do.
-D'oh!

67
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,529
It's not like I'm asking you
to give blood for free.

68
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,331
That would be crazy!

69
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:09,687
When you save a rich man's life,
he showers you with riches.

70
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:13,369
-You know "Hercules and the Lion"?
-Is it a Bible story?

71
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:16,007
Probably.
Once upon a time...

72
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:20,491
...there was a big, mean lion
who got a thorn in his paw.

73
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:24,925
Everyone tried to pull it out
but nobody was strong enough.

74
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,612
They got Hercules.

75
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:30,726
And Hercules used his
mighty strength, and bingo!

76
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,811
The moral is,
the lion was so happy...

77
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:37,369
...he gave Hercules this
big thing of riches.

78
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:40,929
-How did a lion get rich?
-It was the olden days!

79
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:46,484
Hey, let's go! Emergency!
Life or death here!

80
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,332
-Just a sec!
-Otto-man! You work here?

81
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,922
All my friends are in school...

82
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:55,011
...so I got a job as a
bloodletting tech-dude!

83
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:59,411
-Let's get this show on the road.
-Okay. Let me wash up.

84
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,283
Homer. Brave, young Bart.

85
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:08,602
-I don't know which one to hug first.
-The boy.

86
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:26,850
-We're ready with the transfusion.
-I'm not going to make it.

87
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,726
I want to dictate my epitaph.

88
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:34,451
-Go ahead.
-Charles Montgomery Burns:

89
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,570
American...

90
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:40,812
...and patriot.
American patriot.

91
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:44,607
Master of the atom...

92
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:47,129
...scourge of the despot....

93
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:52,523
O, tyrant, hear his
mighty name and quake!

94
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:54,809
Smithers, I'm back!

95
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:56,890
Top of the morning to ye!

96
00:06:57,093 --> 00:07:00,881
Why, look who's here!
It's good old you!

97
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:02,891
Hi, Mr. Burns.

98
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,846
Hey, there, Mr. Brown Shoes.

99
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,403
How about that local
sports team, huh?

100
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:12,605
Mr. Burns. He's okay.
Jackpot!

101
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:21,524
Well, that's game.
Hasta mañana, Osvaldo.

102
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,643
I'm back in the pink!
Full of pith and vinegar!

103
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:29,124
-Just remarkable, sir.
-You know, it's funny.

104
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:33,849
I tried every tincture, poultice,
tonic and medicine there is.

105
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:38,006
And all I really needed was
the blood of a young boy.

106
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:41,046
-What was the lad's name?
-Bart Simpson.

107
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,325
-Who?
-The son of Homer, a stiff in 7-G.

108
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:48,924
The Simpsons will be getting a
very nice surprise in the mail.

109
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,812
Very nice, indeed.

110
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:56,246
Bill. Bill.
Summons. Bill.

111
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:59,007
Wait a minute.
From C.M. Burns.

112
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,488
This is it. Yes, this is it!

113
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:06,728
Bart! Lisa! Maggie!
Let's do this out in the yard!

114
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,845
Dim the lights.
Turn them on. Do something!

115
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:11,247
Yes, Dad.

116
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,483
It's thin, but that's okay.
Could be a check.

117
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,851
There's no check, just a card.
Don't panic.

118
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:24,006
I'm sure it tells us what
we'll get and where to pick it up.

119
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:29,412
Dear Bart, thank you kindly for the
blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns.

120
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:33,012
D'oh! It's just a card!

121
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:39,606
Is that some way to show your
gratitude? No gold, no diamonds.

122
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,526
No rubies, not even a lousy card!

123
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:46,089
Wait, there was a card.
That's what got me so mad!

124
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:51,003
You don't do these things to be
rewarded. You do it to help someone.

125
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:54,211
You're my wife
and I love you very much...

126
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,610
...but you're living
in a world of make-believe.

127
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:00,850
With bells and magic frogs
with funny hats.

128
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:02,924
-We got hosed.
-Bart!

129
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:07,524
We got exactly what we wanted.
We gave an old man a second chance.

130
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:12,210
I promised my boy one simple thing:
lots of riches.

131
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:15,246
And that man broke my promise!
I've had it!

132
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:18,644
Bart, take a letter!
Dear Mr. Burns...

133
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:23,011
...I'm so glad you enjoyed
my son's blood.

134
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:26,211
And your card was just great.

135
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:31,652
In case you can't tell,
I'm being sarcastic. You stink!

136
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:35,442
-Read that last part back to me.
-"You stink!"

137
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:39,925
Good. You are a senile,
bucktoothed old mummy...

138
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:43,609
...with bony girl arms
and you smell like....

139
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:47,641
-An elephant's butt?
-An elephant's butt.

140
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,209
-He's your boss. You have to mail it?
-Yep.

141
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:55,406
-Why don't you sleep on it?
-Forget it.

142
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:59,123
Please, Homie. For me.

143
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,284
Oh, all right.

144
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:08,362
You always do that hand thing.
And it usually works.

145
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,165
Cheap son of a....

146
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:27,211
Homer, breakfast is ready.

147
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:33,092
Marge, you saved me
from making a big mistake.

148
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:36,046
I finally understand
the meaning of....

149
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,164
-Of what?
-Better half.

150
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:41,012
-Thank you.
-Where's the letter?

151
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,204
Where is it?

152
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:53,290
I don't think it is in the
cornstarch canister.

153
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:57,122
It's somewhere.
It didn't just get up and walk away.

154
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:58,965
-Seen the letter?
-Yep.

155
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:01,243
Think very carefully.

156
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:04,724
Where did you see it last?

157
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,924
The last place I saw it...

158
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,045
-...was in my hand...
-Yeah?

159
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,962
...as I was shoving it
into the mailbox.

160
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,162
D'oh!

161
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:17,325
Why did you do that?

162
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:22,209
There were things that had
to be said. And I know you.

163
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:27,328
There was no guarantee
you'd still be mad this morning.

164
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,649
I'll show you mad in the morning!

165
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:34,205
Homer, you encouraged him.
You should be strangling yourself!

166
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,609
She's right.

167
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:40,849
Don't panic. They don't
pick up the mail till noon.

168
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:42,327
There's still time!

169
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:49,448
-Give it up. It's locked up tight.
-Locked, eh?

170
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:53,003
I might have a little surprise
up my sleeve...

171
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:57,405
...for old Mr. Lock.
Step aside, boy.

172
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:06,044
Hey! I'm with you, Homer.
Fight the power!

173
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:11,248
-Why the hose?
-Why do you think?

174
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:15,452
I'll get it so the ink
will run and no one can read it.

175
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:19,851
-But don't other people have mail?
-So they won't get letters.

176
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:23,847
You know the letters people write.
"Dear somebody...

177
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,653
...how is so-and-so?
Blah, blah, blah.

178
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:29,282
Yours truly, Some Bozo."
Big loss.

179
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:33,410
Look out for the mailman.
Give me a signal.

180
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:36,002
-Mailman's here.
-We'll use that.

181
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,522
No, I mean the mailman's here!

182
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,486
God! Are you planning
to water the mail?

183
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:46,011
It wouldn't do any good to run
because you know my name, right?

184
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:49,211
-That's right.
-Well, I'm still gonna run!

185
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:55,561
I want the whole world to hear the
story of my struggle with hypohemia.

186
00:12:55,773 --> 00:13:00,244
Roman is the finest ghostwriter.
He's written Like Hell I Can't.

187
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,929
Up from the Muck.
The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahabaradad.

188
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:09,042
All right. First question:
Have you slept with anyone famous?

189
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:12,450
Countess von Zeppelin and l--
What in blaze--?

190
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,810
Listen to me, you bargain-basement
Baudelaire!

191
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:19,523
I'm not a starlet who can't
string two words together.

192
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,884
I can write this thing myself!
You're fired!

193
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,610
Hello. My name is Mr. Burns.

194
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:35,648
-I believe you have a letter for me.
-What's your first name?

195
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:37,724
I don't know.

196
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:40,602
Great plan, Bart.

197
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:43,441
Oh, look, Maggie! What is that?

198
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:47,652
Dodecahedron! Dodecahedron!

199
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:52,409
I don't know what you're doing
but your father's trying to worry.

200
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:54,166
"Chapter the Fifth. "

201
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:58,651
The trip to the infirmary
with most unexpected results.

202
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:08,408
Twenty-eight minutes till Burns comes.
Time for Operation Mail-Take.

203
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,412
Can I help you?

204
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,407
Don't be frightened.
It's a letter opener. Who are you?

205
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:20,166
Give a fake name.

206
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:21,601
Homer Simpson.

207
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:23,684
Simpson, eh? Simpson!

208
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:27,721
Why, there's a letter from you.
I'll read it right now.

209
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:31,204
"Mr. Burns, I'm glad you
enjoyed my son's blood.

210
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,251
And your card was just great."

211
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:36,006
Why, Simpson!

212
00:14:36,213 --> 00:14:40,092
You've made my day.
You're a true gentleman.

213
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,444
-Well, I'll be on my way.
-Hello, there's more.

214
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:47,606
"In case you can't tell,
I'm being sarcastic.

215
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,368
You stink! You're a senile,
bucktoothed mummy...

216
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:56,010
...with bony girl arms. And you
smell like an elephant's butt!"

217
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:59,731
Come on, Joey.
You have to twist my arm?

218
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,771
I don't tell you
how to do your job, okay?

219
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:06,409
I could crush him like an ant.
But it would be easy.

220
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:09,605
No, revenge is a dish
best served cold.

221
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:13,203
I'll bide my time until....

222
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,052
What the hell,
I'll just crush him.

223
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:22,882
Senile, eh?
Bucktoothed, am I?

224
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:26,091
Bony arms, are they?
Liver spots, did I?

225
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,803
-Shameless, will you?
-His pink slip for you to sign.

226
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,605
Now that's odd.

227
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:37,210
I've just robbed a man of his
livelihood and yet I feel empty.

228
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,525
Tell you what,
have him beaten to a pulp!

229
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:41,768
-But--
-What?!

230
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,201
Nothing, sir.

231
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:47,611
I've never seen him this mad,
and he's always kind of mad.

232
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:52,445
-Me and my big letter-writing pen.
-What's done is done.

233
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,412
No matter what,
we'll pull through.

234
00:15:55,653 --> 00:16:00,169
You can move in with your sisters
and raise the kids and I'll...

235
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:04,412
...die in a gutter. It's practical
and within our means.

236
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:09,448
They said I'd destroy the family.
I never believed it.

237
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:13,845
Nobody believed it.
We were just trying to scare you.

238
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:20,803
-You know Homer Simpson?
-Yeah, nice guy. Play poker with him.

239
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,924
-Beat him up.
-You got it.

240
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:25,004
-Wait.
-What is it?

241
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,642
-Nothing. Wait.
-What?

242
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:30,252
Beat, but...

243
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:32,404
-...don't kick.
-Got it.

244
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:34,410
-Wait.
-What?

245
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:41,493
-What did Homie do anyway?
-He saved Mr. Burns' life.

246
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:48,646
In closing, I'd like to thank you.
"What's that?" you say.

247
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:52,203
"Me, thanking you?"
No, it's not a misprint.

248
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:57,612
I enjoyed writing this book
as much as you enjoyed reading it.

249
00:16:58,173 --> 00:17:00,209
The End.

250
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:04,526
-Smithers. How'd the beating go?
-Sir-- There was no beating.

251
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,611
-That's a hell of a thing! Why?
-Because l--

252
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,730
-I called it off.
-Judas!

253
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:12,965
I'm sorry.
But I just couldn't hurt Homer.

254
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:14,765
-He saved you.
-I see.

255
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:19,444
I know you're mad. I'm gonna
stand outside until you forgive me.

256
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,172
No need, Smithers.

257
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:26,732
You've been the sober ying
to my raging yang.

258
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,004
Put her there, old pal.

259
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:36,884
I wish this handshake would
never end, but we still have...

260
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:42,253
-...the Simpson matter to attend to.
-We do indeed, old friend. We do.

261
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:47,210
-Moe's Tavern.
-Is Mike there? Last name, Rotch.

262
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:51,048
Hold on, I'll check.
Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch!

263
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:54,410
Hey, has anybody seen
Mike Rotch lately?

264
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:58,330
One of these days,
I'm gonna catch you...

265
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:02,009
...and carve my name
on your back with an ice pick.

266
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:06,733
What's up?
You're not your normal self.

267
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:09,533
I got my problems.
Give me another one.

268
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:12,241
Don't drink
to forget your problems.

269
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:16,805
Yeah. You should only drink
to enhance your social skills.

270
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:20,011
We'll get the Simpsons
an extravagant present.

271
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:23,211
An unthinkable,
utterly impossible present!

272
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:27,332
A frabulous, grabulous,
zip-zoop-zabulous present!

273
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,004
Too practical.

274
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:32,803
Too cutesy.

275
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,531
Too cornball.

276
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:42,531
A pool table? I'm not going to
turn his home into a saloon.

277
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:46,646
-Eureka! We've found it!
-But, sir, it's $32,000!

278
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:51,045
Don't you dare sully this moment
with your price-taggery.

279
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:52,322
It's perfect.

280
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:55,002
Oh, woe is me.

281
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:58,165
Oh, my!
It's Mr. Burns.

282
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:01,852
Heave, ho! Heave, ho!
Heave, ho!

283
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,408
Wait, Dad, he's smiling.

284
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:09,610
-You brought us a present!
-What did you think I was gonna do?

285
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:12,606
Have you beaten to a bloody pulp?

286
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:16,887
To show there's no hard feelings,
here's a copy of my book:

287
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:19,448
Will There Ever Be a Rainbow?

288
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:22,042
I haven't forgotten you. Here.

289
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:26,411
-Wow! A crowbar!
-It's to open the crate, stupid.

290
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:32,093
What did I tell you? I bet it's
filled with rubies, sapphire, pearls.

291
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,846
-Wow! A big, ugly head!
-D'oh!

292
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,130
Actually, it's a big, ugly
Olmec Indian head.

293
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:43,922
It was carved by Mesoamerican
Indians 3000 years ago.

294
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:47,967
This gruesome customer is
Xtapolapocetl, the god of war.

295
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:49,652
Awesome!

296
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:54,005
No, Maggie, not Aztec. Olmec.
Olmec.

297
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:56,130
-What does it do?
-Nothing.

298
00:19:56,373 --> 00:20:00,605
-Really, what does it do?
-Whatever it does, it's doing it now.

299
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:05,483
I'll let you get acquainted with
Señor Xtapolapocetl. Ta.

300
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:09,652
-Did you see their faces?
-You're my god of generosity.

301
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:13,203
Save a guy's life and
what do you get? Nothing.

302
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:16,604
Worse than nothing.
Just a big, scary rock.

303
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:20,448
-Don't badmouth the head.
-It's the thought that counts.

304
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,451
The moral is,
a good deed is its own reward.

305
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:27,242
-We got a reward. The head is cool.
-Well, then....

306
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:30,684
I guess the moral is,
no good deed goes unrewarded.

307
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:34,442
Wait a minute.
If I hadn't written that letter...

308
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,207
-...we would've gotten nothing.
-Well....

309
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:41,283
The moral is, the squeaky
wheel gets the grease.

310
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:46,328
-Perhaps there is no moral.
-Exactly! Just stuff that happened.

311
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:51,693
-But it was a memorable few days.
-Amen to that!
