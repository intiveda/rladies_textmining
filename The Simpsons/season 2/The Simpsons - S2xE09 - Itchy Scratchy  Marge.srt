00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,564
Itchy & Scratchy & Marge

2
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:26,843
A dash of rosemary, a smidgen
of thyme, a pinch of marjoram.

3
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:30,563
Marge, you make the best
pork chops in the world.

4
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:35,011
They're nothing special.
The extra ingredient is care.

5
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:41,211
A sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon
of turmeric and a whisper of MSG.

6
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:46,129
-I'm gonna build you a spice rack!
-Don't go to all that trouble for me.

7
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:49,763
It's no trouble!
I've got a garage full of tools.

8
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:55,042
Hey, kids! I spy Itchy and Scratchy
off the port bow!

9
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:58,046
-Down in front!
-Shut up, boy.

10
00:01:58,293 --> 00:02:01,012
They fight and bite
Fight and bite and fight

11
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:05,525
Fight fight fight, bite bite bite
The Itchy and Scratchy Show

12
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,722
I knew this stuff
would be handy.

13
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:26,445
Let's see now, here it is.
The Complete Handyman's Bookshelf.

14
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,127
"Volume One: Spice Racks."

15
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:37,001
"Pick up a hammer."

16
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:43,804
Not as easy as I thought it was.

17
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,971
Wow!

18
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:21,728
-Dad, can you move your head?
-I can't. It's broken.

19
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:27,921
Where would a child get the idea
to attack her father with a mallet?

20
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:47,404
No, Maggie! Bad baby!

21
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:50,924
Keep her away!
She's got that crazy look again!

22
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:57,249
So television's responsible.

23
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,405
We were watching that.

24
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:02,213
You won't be watching any more.
Ever!

25
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:07,243
But if you take them away, we'll grow
up without humor and be robots.

26
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:09,802
Really? What kind of robots?

27
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:13,246
I heard about the cartoons.
Tough break.

28
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:14,812
Thanks, Nelson.

29
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:18,204
What if you watch it
over at my house?

30
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:22,287
Hey, that's just crazy enough
to work.

31
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:26,367
You heard me. I won't be in for
the rest of the week.

32
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:30,647
I told you. My baby beat me up.

33
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:35,091
It is not the worst excuse
I ever thought up. Wise guy.

34
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:39,010
I wonder why the kids
are late getting home.

35
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:59,082
-How come you can watch cartoons?
-Because.

36
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,051
-Because why?
-I said so.

37
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,852
-You said so why?
-I'm trying to work.

38
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:08,042
-What are you doing?
-Cataloguing the violence.

39
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:13,208
I don't think adults have ever
sat down and watched them before.

40
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:27,605
What kind of warped human being
would find that funny?

41
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:35,844
They think this is suitable
for younger, impressionable viewers?

42
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:40,962
-Yeah, what are you gonna do?
-I'll tell you. I'll write a letter!

43
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:46,650
Dear Purveyors of Senseless Violence:

44
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:50,090
I know this may
sound silly at first...

45
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:54,247
...but the cartoons you show
to our children...

46
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,724
...are influencing
their behavior negatively.

47
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:05,041
Please tone down the violence
in your otherwise fine programming.

48
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,488
Yours truly, Marge Simpson.

49
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,288
Take a letter. "Dear Valued Viewer:

50
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,411
Thank you for your interest
in our program.

51
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:18,249
Enclosed is an autographed photo
of America's favorite cat and mouse.

52
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:24,445
As to your comments, research shows
one person can't make a difference...

53
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:26,843
...no matter how screwy she is.

54
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:31,245
-So, let me close by saying...."
-"And the horse I rode in on"!

55
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:35,202
I'll show them
what one screwball can do!

56
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:00,851
Everybody's looking at us, Marge.

57
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:04,290
That's what we want them to do, Homer.

58
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,008
How long are we gonna do this?

59
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:12,286
I've never changed the world.
I don't know how long it takes.

60
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,570
-lf people take an interest--
-Hello, Marge!

61
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,452
-What is "S-N-U-H"?
-Snuh.

62
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:25,172
It's "Springfieldians for Nonviolence,
Understanding and Helping."

63
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:28,450
It's a crusade
against cartoon violence.

64
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:35,087
I can protect my kids, but many others
are being warped each afternoon.

65
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:40,091
That reminds me. I've got to get
to Milhouse's to play.

66
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,528
-All right.
-I'm going to Janey's.

67
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:46,049
We'll be making
the most of our childhood years.

68
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:49,410
-Have fun.
-We will.

69
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:58,651
What happens when a child has insanely
violent role models like these?

70
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:02,329
The answer is all around you.

71
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:06,646
How many of you were hit
with mallets last week?

72
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,846
I didn't know they made
TV dinners this bad.

73
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:18,243
-Can I watch cartoons?
-No.

74
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:21,803
-There's peas in my cobbler.
-They're everywhere.

75
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:28,131
-I guess I'll go and watch cartoons.
-No! I'm sorry about the dinners.

76
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:31,570
-I'll make up for it.
-Who's up for cartoons?

77
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,405
-No one!
-All right.

78
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:37,692
Tomorrow, how about making
your patented pork chops?

79
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:43,451
Sure! Oh, dear, I can't. I've got
three protest rallies tomorrow.

80
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,962
Twenty million women,
and I had to marry Jane Fonda.

81
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:53,048
Hi, kids! Guess what, Sideshow Mel.

82
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:57,650
-It's time for Itchy & Scratchy!
-Boo!

83
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,653
Hey! Settle down, boys and girls.

84
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:05,330
Or Krusty will bring out his friend
Corporal Punishment again.

85
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,046
Please, stop it.

86
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,932
-Who are you people?
-What do we want?

87
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:13,641
Less violence in
kid's programming!

88
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:16,202
-When do we want it?
-Now!

89
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:19,450
They're ruining the show!

90
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,412
Stop! Please, stop!

91
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:25,804
Please, lady, be quiet!

92
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:30,251
I'm trying to earn a living here,
all right? Stop!

93
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:34,406
That woman.
That screwball, Marge Simpson.

94
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,729
We've got to stop her. How?

95
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:39,407
-Drop an anvil?
-Hit her with a piano?

96
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,292
Stuff her with TNT,
throw a match and run?

97
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:47,886
All your degrees and that's
the best you can do? You make me sick.

98
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,727
Less violence
in children's programming!

99
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:52,770
-When do we want it?
-Now!

100
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,606
Less violence
in children's programming!

101
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,810
-When do we want it?
-Now!

102
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,608
I'm so funny!

103
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:09,850
Some of these are good. I never knew
mice lived such lives.

104
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:14,325
So much brutality.
I don't know if I'm having any impact.

105
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:19,123
Don't do that!

106
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:22,046
Hey, don't do that!

107
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,205
Take that, you dumb squirrel!

108
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:33,683
Where do they get their ideas?

109
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,847
What is it? What? Smartline?

110
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:42,213
Yes, I've heard of your late-night
panel discussion show. I'd love to!

111
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:47,004
Smartline! With our local
Emmy-winning host, Kent Brockman.

112
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:51,252
I'm Kent Brockman.
Welcome to another Smartline.

113
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:56,647
Are cartoons too violent? Most people
say, "No! What a stupid question!"

114
00:10:56,813 --> 00:11:00,362
One woman says yes.
She's here tonight. Marge Simpson.

115
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:01,688
There she is!

116
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,209
Also with us for
this animated discussion...

117
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,809
-...are Roger Myers--
-Thank you.

118
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:13,848
--Krusty, whose program brings us
Itchy & Scratchy every afternoon....

119
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:16,323
Hi, Kent!

120
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:21,408
And, joining us via satellite
from Vienna, the home of Freud...

121
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:26,363
...to give insight into the mind,
Dr. Marvin Monroe.

122
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:28,604
Let's see what this is about.

123
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:33,005
Here's an example of the work
being made at I & S Studios.

124
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,848
Hilarious. What's wrong with that?

125
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:47,402
-Nothing's wrong with it.
-Excuse me!

126
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:50,844
-He's asking me.
-I know. Nothing's wrong with it.

127
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:54,642
-It's a bad influence on children.
-Give me a break!

128
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:57,771
That is baloney. And here's why:

129
00:11:58,013 --> 00:12:01,847
I did some research
and discovered a startling thing.

130
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:06,006
There was violence in the past,
before cartoons.

131
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,402
Fascinating.

132
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:11,646
There was the crusades.
Tremendous violence! Many killed!

133
00:12:11,893 --> 00:12:15,522
-It went on for 30 years.
-This was before cartoons?

134
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:19,163
That's right, Kent.
So much for your viewpoint.

135
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:22,371
Dr. Monroe, would you care to comment?

136
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:25,605
To me, the high jinks
of comic characters...

137
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:30,847
...pales in comparison with
the problems I run into everyday.

138
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:36,690
I'm referring to women who love too
much, fear of winning, sex-aholism.

139
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:40,369
So you have no objection
to Itchy & Scratchy?

140
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:42,251
No, not at all.

141
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:48,443
One of my guilty little pleasures
is to turn on Itchy & Scratchy...

142
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:52,208
...and laugh myself silly.
What's wrong with that?

143
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:55,411
Not a thing.
Now, for another opinion.

144
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,171
Hi, kids!

145
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:01,810
Please. This is your chance to
participate in a serious discussion.

146
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:07,965
I'm sorry, Kent. It's just when
the camera gets on me--

147
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:09,805
-Krusty!
-Sorry.

148
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,248
We won't settle this tonight.

149
00:13:12,493 --> 00:13:17,408
Mrs. Simpson, in the nine seconds
left, can you summarize your position?

150
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:21,805
I'd ask the parents
concerned about this to write in.

151
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:25,170
Let the cartoon makers
know how you feel.

152
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:30,248
I don't believe it. "I won't
watch your show, buy your products...

153
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:34,202
...or brake if I see you
crossing the street."

154
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:37,013
Wow, that's cold.

155
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:42,809
"Dear Sleaze Merchant. "
Now, come on, that hurts.

156
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:47,087
Gentlemen, the screwballs have spoken.

157
00:13:58,053 --> 00:13:59,042
Hello?

158
00:13:59,293 --> 00:14:01,249
-Is this Marge Simpson?
-Yes.

159
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:04,803
The Marge who fixed it so cartoons
can't be violent?

160
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,042
Yes.

161
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:10,485
This is Myers with the writers.
How do we end this picture?

162
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:12,805
What's the problem?

163
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:17,848
-Itchy stole Scratchy's ice cream--
-Make it a pie. Easier to draw.

164
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,208
Okay, a pie.

165
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:22,570
Scratchy is understandably upset.

166
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,610
We figured he'd grab Itchy...

167
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:27,048
-...and toss him in acid.
-Oh, dear.

168
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:33,448
But we thought it might be violent,
which is wrong now, thanks to you.

169
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:34,967
What's your idea?

170
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:39,206
-How do we end this?
-Let's see....

171
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:45,604
Couldn't Itchy share his pie with
Scratchy? Then they'd both have pie.

172
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:51,048
It's different, I'll give you that.

173
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:55,206
A tool every handyman needs.
It's a jigsaw! A drill!

174
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:59,844
It's an asphalt spreader!
It's 67 tools in one!

175
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:03,324
-How much would you pay for all this?
-$1000!

176
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:05,165
-Don't answer yet.
-Sorry.

177
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,291
-You also get--
-I was watching that!

178
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,252
-Time for Krusty.
-We can watch cartoons?

179
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,247
-Yes, dear. All you want.
-All right!

180
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:19,850
-Turn it up!
-Hey kids! Time for Itchy & Scratchy!

181
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:25,203
They love, they share
They share and love and share

182
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:30,049
Love love love, share share share
The Itchy & Scratchy Show!

183
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,008
Lemonade?

184
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,406
-Please.
-I made it just for you.

185
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:48,401
You are my best friend.

186
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:51,451
Itchy and Scratchy
have lost their edge.

187
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,048
It's a nice message of sharing.

188
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:55,567
I think it sucks.

189
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,412
Thank you, Maggie.

190
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:02,451
-This hits the spot.
-Doesn't it?

191
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:06,003
-You make good lemonade.
-Thank you, Itchy.

192
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:13,411
Wasn't that funny, boys and girls?
Well? Wasn't it?

193
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,612
Aren't you going to watch the rest?

194
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:20,562
-No. Come on.
-Maybe there's something else to do.

195
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:31,686
But the third bowl of porridge
was just right.

196
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:37,292
Hi, kids!

197
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:42,404
What? Is this Saturday?

198
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,848
What did you kids do today?

199
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:49,325
We went fishing.
Almost caught a catfish this big.

200
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:52,485
I went bird watching
and saw a grackle.

201
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:53,927
That's nice, dear.

202
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,006
-Let's finish our soapbox racers.
-Okay.

203
00:17:57,213 --> 00:18:00,205
-May we please be excused?
-Sure.

204
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:05,049
Wow! What great kids.
This is the golden age, Marge!

205
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,727
The parents owe it all to you.

206
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:11,883
I didn't expect things
to change this much.

207
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,170
I always knew you'd make
the world better.

208
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:22,848
This will be the art event of the
century! Michelangelo's David...

209
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:25,004
...on a tour of the U.S.

210
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:27,727
Which cities will be
in your itinerary?

211
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,441
-New York, Springfield--
-Yes?

212
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,161
If we have time,
Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles.

213
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:42,002
-Marge, get the door.
-What in the world?

214
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:50,169
Get dressed, Marge. Lead our protest
against this abomination.

215
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,849
That's Michelangelo's David.
It's a masterpiece.

216
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:59,247
Filth. It portrays parts of the body
which, though practical, are evil.

217
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:03,532
-I like that statue.
-I knew she was soft on nudity.

218
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,286
Come on, girls.

219
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:11,809
What is this?
What do you want?

220
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:15,289
We want your big Italian butt
out of here!

221
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:19,526
Smartline. With our local host,
Kent Brockman.

222
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:23,448
A masterpiece?
Or just a guy with his pants down?

223
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:25,809
That's our topic tonight.

224
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:30,730
-Why are you against the statue?
-I'm not. Everyone should see it.

225
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:35,445
-Aren't you Marge Simpson, the wacko?
-Yes and no.

226
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:41,051
How can you be for one form of
expression, like our naked friend...

227
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:46,008
...and be against another form,
like Itchy & Scratchy?

228
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,051
-Good question.
-Well, I guess I can't.

229
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,602
It's a shame.
I hate those cartoons.

230
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:58,008
What do you say to those out there
who wish to suppress David 's doodle?

231
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:04,325
I don't know. One person can make
a difference but probably shouldn't.

232
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:06,928
Well, I guess that settles that.

233
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,641
We will be ending early tonight.

234
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:14,170
Tomorrow our topic will be "Religion:
Which Is the One True Faith?"

235
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:53,170
-There he is, Michelangelo's Dave.
-David.

236
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:55,848
-What's wrong, Marge?
-Oh, Homie.

237
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:58,812
The kids have a chance
to see great art.

238
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:02,807
But they're watching a cat
and mouse disembowel each other.

239
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,452
Don't worry, Marge.

240
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:09,892
Soon every kid in school is going
to come and see this thing.

241
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:14,206
-Really? Why?
-They're forcing them!

242
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:18,605
Well, isn't that nice?
