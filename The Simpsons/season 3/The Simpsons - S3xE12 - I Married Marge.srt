00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:07,494
<i>## The Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,390
D'oh!

3
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:25,934
''Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test''?

4
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,774
Homer, shouldn't we have
gone with a better-known brand?

5
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:32,714
But, Marge, this one came
with a free corncob pipe.

6
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:35,217
Okay, let's see.

7
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:36,617
''Ahoy, mateys.

8
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:39,281
''If the water turns blue,
a baby for you.

9
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:41,950
''If purple ye see, no baby thar be.''

10
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:44,893
Well, what color is it--
blue or purple?

11
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:45,894
Pink.

12
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:46,657
D'oh!

13
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,061
''If a test should fail...

14
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,623
to a doctor set sail.''

15
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,499
I guess I better go see Dr. Hibbert.

16
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,868
Oh, honey...

17
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,203
do you really think you're pregnant?

18
00:01:57,274 --> 00:02:00,675
I have the same nausea
and craving for pancake mix...

19
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:02,678
I did with the other kids.

20
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,681
And I have the same
tightness in my chest...

21
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:07,683
and profuse sweating I always get.

22
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:09,184
I'll let you know.

23
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:17,025
Homer, how come Mom's
going to the doctor?

24
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:18,356
Is anything wrong?

25
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,487
Everything's fine.

26
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:21,793
Your mother, uh...
just broke her leg.

27
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:23,856
I smell a bun in the oven.

28
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:26,869
Is Mom going to have another baby, Dad?

29
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,199
Maybe.

30
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,705
- Whoa!
- Hey, all right!

31
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:30,865
Way to go!

32
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,841
You're a machine, Homer.

33
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,377
Did you hear that, Maggie?

34
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,776
Another baby in the house.

35
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:36,870
Oh, cool.

36
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:38,209
We can race 'em.

37
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:40,773
Sure, for you,
a baby's all fun and games.

38
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:43,251
For me, it's diaper changes
and midnight feedings.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,617
Doesn't Mom do that?

40
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:45,950
Yeah, but I hear about it.

41
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:47,957
Were you like this
when Mom was pregnant with me?

42
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,993
I threw up more than your mother.

43
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,326
It all happened at the beginning
of that turbulent decade...

44
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:55,490
known as the '80s.

45
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,500
Those were idealistic days--

46
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:01,004
The candidacy ofJohn Anderson,
the rise of Supertramp.

47
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:03,631
It was an exciting time to be young.

48
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:10,179
<i>For several years
I'd been dating your mother...</i>

49
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:13,045
<i>and working at the local fun center.</i>

50
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:15,677
Homer, you turn the blades too fast.

51
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,618
The golfers are complaining.

52
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:18,882
Slow down!

53
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:20,514
That's better.

54
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,523
Ah, beautiful.

55
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:22,684
Keep this up...

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,887
and someday you'll be the guy...

57
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,691
who hands out the putters.

58
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:27,856
Yes, sir!

59
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,865
<i>I was 2 4 years old...</i>

60
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,562
with a beautiful girlfriend
and a job with a future.

61
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:36,530
You're supposed to be listening...

62
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,199
to my story!

63
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,606
I thought it was over.

64
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,111
You had a problem turning blades.
You overcame it.

65
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,942
The feel-good story of the year.

66
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:46,881
It's not our fault our generation
has short attention spans.

67
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,214
We watch an appalling amount ofTV.

68
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:52,949
Don't you ever, ever
talk that way about television.

69
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,650
You lousy, ungrateful...

70
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:58,593
can't-keep-their,
what-do-you-call-it...

71
00:03:58,662 --> 00:03:59,890
minds-on-any, uh...

72
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,176
Okay, girls, you can smoke now.

73
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:16,174
Mmm.

74
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:19,515
Oh, yeah.

75
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:21,683
It's Homer!

76
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:23,413
I don't know what you see...

77
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,011
in that ugly meatball.

78
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,351
Uh-huh.

79
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:29,688
If you like being pawed
by something fat and lazy...

80
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,352
we could get a cat.

81
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:34,363
It would leave less hair on the couch.

82
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,025
You don't know Homer like I do.

83
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:39,365
He's sensitive and sweet.

84
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:42,371
<i>Marge, get your butt out here.!</i>

85
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,872
Mmm.

86
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:47,172
Homer, do you ever think
about the future?

87
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,804
You mean like
will apes be our masters?

88
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,644
No, how you plan to earn a living.

89
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:55,310
I can't imagine that job
of yours is stimulating.

90
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:57,479
It gives me time to think.

91
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:59,419
What do you think about?

92
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,514
Well, girls.

93
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,558
I mean boys!

94
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,649
I mean you.

95
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:04,489
I think about you too.

96
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,326
Wow, what an ending.

97
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,993
Who would have thought...

98
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,503
Darth Vader
was Luke Skywalker's father?

99
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:17,972
Well, thank you,
Mr. Blow-The-Picture-For-Me.

100
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,168
Marge, you're as pretty
as Princess Leia...

101
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:22,007
and as smart as Yoda.

102
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,671
Oh, Homer.

103
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:24,975
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

104
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:09,649
I bet the guy
she was singing that about...

105
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,159
was real happy.

106
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:13,696
Actually, she was singing about God.

107
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:15,994
Oh, well, he's always happy.

108
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:17,693
No, wait, he's always mad.

109
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,333
Someday I'll buy you a real castle.

110
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:22,838
You don't have to do that.

111
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,339
Whoo, good.

112
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:27,673
Homer, maybe
it's the Champale talking...

113
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:30,679
but I think you're pretty sexy.

114
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:32,009
Really?

115
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:35,074
It must be the Champale talking.

116
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:37,677
<i>Oh, Homer, what if we get caught?</i>

117
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:38,846
<i>Don't worry.</i>

118
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:42,016
<i>This castle is impregnable.</i>

119
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,864
Pass the cookie dough.

120
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:52,299
Dust off your hula skirts, angels.

121
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,462
There's been a murder in Hawaii.

122
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,302
Hawaii, it is, Charlie.

123
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:01,310
Hello?

124
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:02,606
Oh, hi, Marge.

125
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:05,011
I need you to drive me
to the doctor, Homer.

126
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:06,014
Why, what's wrong?

127
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,141
Well...

128
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,242
that unforgettable night we...

129
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,184
joined the castle club.

130
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:12,950
Oh.

131
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:16,618
Well, Miss Bouvier...

132
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,627
we found the reason...

133
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,629
why you've been throwing up
in the morning.

134
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:21,959
Congratulations.

135
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:24,660
D'oh!

136
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,134
Poor guy.

137
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:28,671
Perhaps this pamphlet
will prove helpful.

138
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,037
''So You've Ruined Your Life.''

139
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,097
Mmm.

140
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:34,109
Son, you've got to marry that girl.

141
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:35,439
Because it's honorable?

142
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:38,140
No! Because you'll
never do any better.

143
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,080
You lucky bum.

144
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,482
The fish jumped right in the boat.

145
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:46,011
All you got to do
is whack her with the oar.

146
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,750
Marge, there's something
I want to ask you...

147
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:53,295
but I'm afraid
because if you say ''no''...

148
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:56,127
it'll destroy me
and make me a criminal.

149
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,429
I haven't said ''no'' to you lately.

150
00:07:58,502 --> 00:07:59,867
Marge, I--

151
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,428
Damn it, where's that card?

152
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:03,734
What card?

153
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,537
I wrote down what I was
going to say on a card.

154
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,478
Stupid thing must have
fallen out of my pocket.

155
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:13,012
Is this it?

156
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,141
What's it say?

157
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:17,152
''Marge, from the first moment
I saw you...

158
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,155
I never wanted to be with anyone else.

159
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,660
I don't have much to offer you
except all my love.

160
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:26,958
Will you marry me?''

161
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,962
That's the card.

162
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,328
Oh, Homer...

163
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,335
this is the most beautiful
moment of my life.

164
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:35,735
So, will you marry me?

165
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,467
Yes!

166
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,975
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

167
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:42,341
Yeah, she's going to marry me!

168
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:44,175
In your face, everybody!

169
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,680
Whoo-hoo!

170
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:53,287
If the new baby is a girl,
can we name her Ariel?

171
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:56,658
The baby's name will be
Kool Moe Dee Simpson.

172
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:57,661
Ariel.

173
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,822
Kool Moe Dee.

174
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:00,160
- Ariel.
- Kool Moe Dee.

175
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:03,497
You know,
I had this very same discussion...

176
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,060
with your mother ten years ago.

177
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:09,336
<i>If the baby's a boy...</i>

178
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:11,933
what do you think
of the name Larry?

179
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,171
We can't do that.

180
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:15,770
All the kids
will call him Larry Fairy.

181
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,611
Well, how about Louis?

182
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,173
They'll call him Screwy Louie.

183
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:20,183
- Bob?
- Slob.

184
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,184
- Luke?
- Puke.

185
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:22,379
- Marcus?
- Mucus.

186
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:23,614
What about Bart?

187
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,678
Let's see.

188
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:27,021
Bart, cart, dart, e-art--

189
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:30,289
Nope. Can't see
any problem with that.

190
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,193
<i>Wow. I'll take that ring.</i>

191
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,698
And how will you be paying for it?

192
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,257
I don't know.

193
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,769
<i>Finally, the big day came.</i>

194
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:40,498
<i>We didn't have much money...</i>

195
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:43,040
<i>so we went to
a quaint little chapel...</i>

196
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:45,042
<i>just across the state line.</i>

197
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:50,047
Basic ceremony is 20 bucks.

198
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:51,480
Here's your license.

199
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,211
Get this punched every time.

200
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:55,219
The tenth wedding is on the house.

201
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,312
This marriage is gonna last forever.

202
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,755
No matter how many times
I hear that...

203
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,224
it always makes me laugh.

204
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:06,287
Cletus, do you take Aileen
to be your lawful wedded wife?

205
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:06,956
Yup.

206
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,431
Done. Next.

207
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,567
There certainly are...

208
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,733
a lot of stains on the ceiling.

209
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:17,901
Marge, I'm sorry.

210
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:20,411
I wish I could afford a better place.

211
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,413
Homer, I'd be lying if I said...

212
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,245
that this is how
I pictured my wedding day...

213
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,751
<i>but you are
how I pictured my husband.</i>

214
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,789
- I am?
- You may not look like Ted Bessell...

215
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:33,984
but you're just as nice.

216
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,151
Ohhh.

217
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,855
We are gathered here
in the sight of God...

218
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,591
and this casino to join--

219
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:40,859
Homer.

220
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,161
- And--
- Marge.

221
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:44,361
In holy matrimony. Beautiful.

222
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,701
Do you, Marjorie Bouvier,
take Homer Simpson...

223
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,866
to be your lawful wedded husband?

224
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,034
I do.

225
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,078
Homer, same question,
names reversed.

226
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:54,373
I do.

227
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,971
By the power vested in me
by the state gaming commission...

228
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,710
I pronounce you man and wife.

229
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,445
Here's $1 0 worth of chips.

230
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,384
You may kiss the bride.

231
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,478
<i>Next.!</i>

232
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,051
Mmm. What a perfect day.

233
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:14,065
Our first night together
as man and wife.

234
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,226
Mmm.

235
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,793
Hey, love birds, keep it down.

236
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,070
Look what I got, Marge.

237
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,077
A baby monitor.

238
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,170
Baby to Marge.
Baby to Marge.

239
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:29,407
Wah! Wah! Over.

240
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,416
I don't know how
we can afford these things...

241
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,076
on your salary.

242
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:37,520
Hey, why don't I apply
at the nuclear power plant?

243
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:39,489
I hear they pay pretty well.

244
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:42,823
I heard radiation
can make you sterile.

245
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:44,385
Now you tell me.

246
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,329
We only have two openings...

247
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,995
so one of you will go home
empty-handed.

248
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:55,302
But it won't be
my old frat buddy...

249
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:56,864
Lou Collier.

250
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,103
How you doing, you old Alpha Tau?

251
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:02,045
Smithers, you keg-meister, you.

252
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:04,275
- Uh-huh-huh, hey.
- Uh-huh-huh, hey.

253
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,375
Well, hey,
I'm from the Alabama chapter.

254
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:09,614
Well, I'll be.

255
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:13,083
Let's get on with the testing.

256
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:28,966
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear...

257
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,168
he was trying to moon us.

258
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,507
What would you say
is your worst quality?

259
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:34,910
<i>I am a workaholic.</i>

260
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,743
I push myself too hard.

261
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:39,511
It takes me a long time
to learn anything.

262
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:41,314
I'm kind of a goof-off--

263
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,182
That will do.

264
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,381
Stuff starts disappearing--

265
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:46,856
That's enough.
There's a problem with the reactor.

266
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,051
What do you do?

267
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,595
A problem with the reactor?!

268
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,027
We're all going to die!

269
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,894
Run!

270
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:57,026
Mmm... mmm.

271
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:58,535
Did you get the job?

272
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:00,868
Nah, they wanted someone good.

273
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:02,167
Story of my life.

274
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,868
Oh, Homey.

275
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:07,207
Hey, come over here
and feel our baby kicking.

276
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,213
Wow.

277
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,215
Kid, I won't let you down.

278
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:13,046
When you come out of there...

279
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:15,712
the first thing
you're going to see...

280
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:18,221
is a man with a good job.

281
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,882
Yeah. The doctor.

282
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:30,196
...and when ye tallow hardens,
we remove it from yon mold.

283
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:35,603
What a crappy candle.

284
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,574
<i>You've ruined our vacation.</i>

285
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:41,170
You, gentle sir, are fired.

286
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:42,804
Oh!

287
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,344
Oh, hello, young man.

288
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,979
Good evening, madam.

289
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:53,183
You have been selected by Slash-Co...

290
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:54,520
to reap the benefits...

291
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:57,027
of their new Never-Dull knife edge.

292
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:59,359
Here. Shake hands
with the Slash-Co.

293
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,599
Handle first, handle first.

294
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:08,873
Hmm.

295
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:11,974
I quit! I quit!

296
00:14:12,044 --> 00:14:15,571
I thought you said you liked dogs.

297
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,552
Hey! Who wants to get rich today?

298
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:25,055
- Me! Me!
- Me!

299
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:26,215
Me! Me! Me!

300
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,383
I said it first.

301
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,721
Let me assure you...

302
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:31,888
that this is not one of
those shady pyramid schemes...

303
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:33,226
you've been hearing about.

304
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,061
Our model is the trapezoid...

305
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:38,159
that guarantees each investor
an 800% return...

306
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:40,467
within hours of your initial--

307
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:42,507
<i>- Uh-oh! The cops!</i>

308
00:14:43,742 --> 00:14:45,004
''Fourth notice.''

309
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:46,669
''90 days overdue.''

310
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:48,337
''We break thumbs.''

311
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:51,177
Homer, what are we going to do?

312
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,717
I don't know.

313
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:53,716
I don't know.

314
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:54,843
Repo man.

315
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,013
I'm here for the baby's things.

316
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,681
Crib, mobile, monitor...

317
00:14:58,757 --> 00:15:01,021
and the lady's ring, I'm afraid.

318
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:04,695
Oh, dear.

319
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:05,855
Repossessing stuff...

320
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,865
is the hardest part of my job.

321
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,803
<i>Dear Marge.</i>

322
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,367
<i>By the time you read this,
I will be gone.</i>

323
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:22,538
<i>You deserve all the finest things...</i>

324
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,707
<i>and although I can
give them to you...</i>

325
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,375
<i>they will be repossessed...</i>

326
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,885
<i>and I will be hunted down like a dog.</i>

327
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:30,546
<i>Also, it has become clear...</i>

328
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:33,056
<i>that your family
doesn't want me here.</i>

329
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,492
Shut up with
that pen scratching down there.

330
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,325
<i>I will send you every cent I earn...</i>

331
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,763
<i>for the baby...</i>

332
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:44,791
<i>but you will not see me again
until I am a man.</i>

333
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,508
That is so sad.

334
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,845
Oh, come on, honey.

335
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,681
You know how it turns out.

336
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,187
After all,
you wouldn't be here today...

337
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,348
if I hadn't become...

338
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,858
the responsible head of a household.

339
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:11,020
Can we have a can of frosting
for lunch?

340
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,962
Okay.

341
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:16,829
''You will not see me again...

342
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,491
until I am a man.''

343
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:22,337
Oh, Homer...

344
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:24,498
Homer!

345
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,098
We're all in shock.

346
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:29,872
I thought he'd two-time you
for a while first.

347
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,777
This taco is full of hair.

348
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:39,913
Uh-huh.

349
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:41,854
There's your explanation.

350
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:46,823
Shall we tell Marge?

351
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:50,354
Let her read about it
in the society page.

352
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:53,801
Homer?!

353
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,235
Oh.

354
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:57,397
Marge, listen, we just saw--

355
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:58,701
Don't be stupid.

356
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:07,616
<i>Dear Marge, X-X-X--</i>

357
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:08,672
<i>Homer.</i>

358
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:12,880
Big shots...

359
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,549
with their stainless steel
lunch boxes.

360
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,519
They get doughnuts!

361
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:22,723
That's right.

362
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,960
All the colors of the rainbow.

363
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:28,265
Wow.

364
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:30,931
Marge, what are you doing up?

365
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,497
You need rest.

366
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:36,272
I heard a noise outside,
and thought it might be Homer.

367
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:37,573
Ay!

368
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:38,807
What the hell.

369
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:41,611
Marge, I've got 2½/ words for you.

370
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,584
Gulp 'n' Blow.

371
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:46,621
Yeah, what do you want?

372
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,657
My husband by my side.

373
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:50,715
You want fries with that?

374
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:51,350
Homer?!

375
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:52,894
Marge?!

376
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:55,323
Homer!

377
00:17:55,398 --> 00:17:56,490
Marge!

378
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,792
Holy cow, you're as big as a house!

379
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,338
Homer, come home with me.

380
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:04,771
No, Marge, I can't.

381
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,172
I mean, look at me.

382
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:07,641
I'm a trainee.

383
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,237
They won't even tell me
what's in the secret sauce.

384
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:14,215
And I can't buy you
a decent wedding ring.

385
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:18,242
Any ring is fine,
as long as it's from you.

386
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:22,347
Marge...

387
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:24,188
<i>pour vous.</i>

388
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,160
Oh!

389
00:18:28,197 --> 00:18:30,324
Would you mind if I took it off?

390
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:32,458
The oil is burning my finger.

391
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:33,661
Oh, sure.

392
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:38,134
Homer, do you know
why I married you?

393
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,299
I knocked you up.

394
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,367
<i>No, because I love you.</i>

395
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,476
Come home soon.

396
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,155
<i>That's it.</i>

397
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:05,166
Come closer.

398
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:11,105
Ironic, isn't it?

399
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:12,936
The hunter has become the hunted.

400
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,268
Oh, God, Smithers...

401
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:17,937
I feel so alive!

402
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:18,946
You the boss?

403
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:20,778
- Yes.
- I'll call Security.

404
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,181
Listen, Mr. Big Shot...

405
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:24,185
if you're looking for
the kind of employee...

406
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:27,279
who takes abuse and never
sticks up for himself...

407
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:28,414
I'm your man!

408
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:29,958
Treat me like dirt--

409
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:33,257
<i>I'll still kiss your butt
and call it ice cream!</i>

410
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,957
<i>If you don't like it, I can change!</i>

411
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:38,091
Hold the phone, Smithers.

412
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:40,759
I like your attitude.

413
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,360
Feisty, yet spineless.

414
00:19:42,438 --> 00:19:43,962
This man failed
the aptitude test...

415
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,770
and got trapped in a closet
on his way out.

416
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:47,774
I don't care.

417
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:49,902
I haven't been this impressed...

418
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:52,880
since I first laid eyes on
a young bootlick named Waylon Smithers.

419
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:53,779
You mean...?

420
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,373
Welcome aboard, son.

421
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:56,611
I got the job.

422
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:57,618
I got the job!

423
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:58,779
Whoo-hoo!

424
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,652
Only in America could I get a job!

425
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:03,624
Who was that young hellcat?

426
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:04,887
Homer Simpson.

427
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,053
Simpson, eh?

428
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:07,891
I'll remember that name.

429
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:09,090
Marge, Marge!

430
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,564
You're a little late.

431
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,225
She's gone to the hospital.

432
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:13,325
The hospital?!

433
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:14,835
I'll drive you.

434
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:15,996
Thanks, Mom.

435
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:17,767
Don't ever call me that.

436
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,307
Where's the baby?

437
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,899
Where you left it.

438
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:21,909
Shut up.

439
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:23,002
Listen, fat boy--

440
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,068
<i>No, you listen.</i>

441
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:26,080
This is my wife, and my kid.

442
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:28,082
I'm paying for this delivery.

443
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,014
If you wanna stay...

444
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:30,746
you give me some respect.

445
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,344
Homer, does this mean...?

446
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:35,015
Tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!

447
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:36,353
Good God!

448
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:39,553
Tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna buy your ring back.

449
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,859
Doesn't your job start tomorrow?

450
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:43,865
Somebody will cover for me.

451
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,423
Homer, that's... Oh!

452
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:46,433
Step aside.

453
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:48,026
I'll deliver this baby.

454
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:50,368
Why don't you let me handle it?

455
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:52,134
Oh, a college boy, eh?

456
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,768
Homer, let him deliver the baby!

457
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:58,075
Homey, isn't he beautiful?

458
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:01,116
As long as he's got eight fingers
and eight toes...

459
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,048
he's fine by me.

460
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,051
Oh, Bart!

461
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,179
Daddy's little angel.

462
00:21:07,323 --> 00:21:08,449
Ah!

463
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,321
Why, you little...!

464
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:13,089
He did that on purpose!

465
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:14,254
How could he?

466
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,264
He's only ten minutes old.

467
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,532
Bart, Lisa, come here for a minute.

468
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:23,538
You know, son,
the day you were born...

469
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:25,938
I received the greatest gift...

470
00:21:26,008 --> 00:21:27,270
a man could have.

471
00:21:27,343 --> 00:21:28,935
As the years went by...

472
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:31,536
your mother and I
were blessed twice more...

473
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:35,380
and not a day goes by we don't
thank God for all three of you.

474
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:36,383
Homer!

475
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:38,044
I'm not pregnant!

476
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,052
Yeah!

477
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:40,053
Whoa!

478
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:41,555
Excellent, Marge!

479
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,489
Yes!
