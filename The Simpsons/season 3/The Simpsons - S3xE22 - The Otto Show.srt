<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:07,388
D'oh!

3
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,920
Hey, Homer, let's book!

4
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,626
I want to whip eggs
at the warm-up act.

5
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:30,602
Wow, my concert-going jacket
still fits.

6
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,470
And this is where
I used to hide my beer.

7
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,173
Billy Beer!

8
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:42,610
My little guy's
first rock concert.

9
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:45,651
I hope the Spinal Taps
don't play too loud.

10
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,246
Oh, I went to thousands
of heavy metal concerts...

11
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,846
and it never hurt me.

12
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,565
I hear you.

13
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:00,759
Come on, boy.

14
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,392
There goes
Davy Crockett...

15
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,403
in his bald-skin cap.

16
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:09,675
In other Spinal Tap news...

17
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:12,576
Mayor Quimby honored
the aging super group...

18
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:14,409
in a ceremony at city hall.

19
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:18,508
''Tapping'' into
the ''spines'' of young voters, huh?

20
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:20,348
Let's play the tape.

21
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:25,586
Hey, Milhouse,
cool jacket.

22
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,220
It cost me 50,000
Bazooka Joe comics.

23
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,427
Meet me here
after the show.

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,432
Thanks, Dad.

25
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,627
You won't be bored?

26
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:38,603
Boy, some of the best times
I've ever had...

27
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:40,765
were in
the back seat of a car.

28
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,272
<i>Ohhh...</i>

29
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:47,313
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

30
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:54,778
Ahh.

Spinal Tap kicking
Moammar Khadafy...

34
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,218
in the butt.

35
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,728
A timeless classic.

36
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,560
Hey, Bill
and Marty here.

37
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,725
And we're rapping
with the Tap.

38
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,894
Fellas, this phrase
has dogged you...

39
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,562
throughout your career--

40
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:12,900
''Washed up.''

41
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:16,409
Yet you're among the top 1 05
concert acts today.

42
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:18,068
What's your secret, guys?

43
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,409
After the Berlin Wall fell
our records started selling...

44
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:23,813
on the dismal side
of the Iron Curtain.

45
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,818
That gave us a boost.

46
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:28,753
We're big in Bulgaria,
and the other Garia.

47
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:29,948
Hungaria?

48
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,115
Who's benefited...

49
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:34,422
more from the death
of communism than us?

50
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:38,089
Maybe the people who live
in communist countries.

51
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:39,688
I bet
you're right.

52
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:42,428
But we each just bought
our own soccer team.

53
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,663
How many Hungarios
can say that?

54
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,569
Test... test...

55
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,541
Gee, I'm sorry, man.

56
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,771
Huh?

57
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:54,211
About the frisbee.

58
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,441
Frisbee?

59
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:56,880
Would you mind...

60
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,383
recording some promos?

61
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,440
Like what?

62
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,713
Maybe you could say...

63
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:03,779
''Nobody rocks
like Bill and Marty on KBBL.''

64
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:04,949
We don't know that.

65
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,220
What if somebody rocks
as good as you?

66
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,226
Or better.

67
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:09,887
We don't want
to look stupid.

68
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:10,895
We respect that.

69
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:12,556
How about,
''Rock-a-doodle-doo!

70
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,566
You're listening
to Bill and Marty''?

71
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,465
- Yeah, sure.
- That's good.

72
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,470
Tap! Tap! Tap!

73
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:20,438
There's puddles
of water...

74
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:22,771
all over
the freakin' stage.

75
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:24,469
Well, I don't want to lie.

76
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,274
Six days a week the place
is a hockey rink.

77
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:29,440
Well, this is
a rock concert...

78
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:32,417
not the bleedin'...
splish-splash show.

79
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:33,474
Ladies and gentlemen...

80
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,487
boys and girls...

81
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:39,252
Duff Beer, in association
with Laramie Cigarettes...

82
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:41,920
is proud to welcome Spinal Tap!

83
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:23,796
Medium setting.

84
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,981
Thank you!

85
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,898
All right!

86
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,197
This morning
we were driving down...

87
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,066
route 401 .

88
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,073
That's only four miles
from my house!

89
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:05,077
And we thought they could rock
in Shelbyville.

90
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,709
But nobody rocks like...

91
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,750
Springfield!

92
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:28,127
Well, it seems
some silly twit...

93
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,897
did not get a big enough
oxygen pump...

94
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,530
but that's supposed
to be a devil.

95
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:36,439
Filled with air,
it's very evil and impressive.

96
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,946
<i>We salute you,
our half-inflated dark lord!</i>

97
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:43,073
- Oy!
- Oy!

98
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,411
Oy!

99
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:54,923
People think there are only
five members of Spinal Tap...

100
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:56,928
but they're wrong.

101
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,226
Could we turn up
the house lights?

102
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,790
That was the cue
to turn up the lights...

103
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,597
so we can tell
the audience...

104
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,833
they're the sixth member
of the freakin' group!

105
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,204
We are trying
to put a tiny thrill...

106
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,209
into their gray little lives.

107
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,369
Oh, forget it.

108
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:14,003
Turn on the lasers.

109
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,047
Aah! My vision.

110
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:18,209
That's it.

111
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:19,410
Show's over.

112
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:20,578
Good night, Springden.

113
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,746
There will be no encores.

114
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,890
They were only on
for 20 minutes.

115
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:31,430
What a gyp.

116
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,227
Gnarly show, man.

117
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:35,563
Want to trash
the stage?

118
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:37,398
Okay.

119
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,028
Aah!

120
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,450
Tonight the city weeps...

121
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,354
as for the first time ever...

122
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:01,450
a hockey arena becomes
the scene of violence...

123
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:04,122
following a concert
by Spinal Tap.

124
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,529
I hope my poor
little baby's okay.

125
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:07,964
See for yourself.

126
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:10,634
Unh!

127
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,532
It would be wrong
to suggest...

128
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:16,302
this sort of mayhem
began with rock and roll.

129
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:18,003
After all, there were riots...

130
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,773
<i>at the premiere of Mozart's
The Magic Flute.</i>

131
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,111
So, what's the answer--
ban all music?

132
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:25,947
In this reporter's opinion,
the answer is yes.

133
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,111
Hi, Mom.

134
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,212
Oh...

135
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,278
Oh, thank God.

136
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,551
Mom, I want to be a rock star.

137
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,559
Mm... We'll discuss it later.

138
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:36,959
Is Milhouse okay?

139
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,962
Uh...

140
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,896
I'll be right back.

141
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:44,570
Help!

142
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,070
Help!

143
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,192
I've been thinking
about what Bart said.

144
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,397
If he's really interested
in being a musician...

145
00:08:58,472 --> 00:08:59,962
let's buy him a guitar.

146
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,372
We already have
a guitar.

147
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,542
I meant a real guitar.

148
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,706
This is real.

149
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,976
Wow!

150
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,886
And it came with
a free instruction book.

151
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,719
We spent a lot of money...

152
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,385
<i>so you get real good,
real fast, or pow.!</i>

153
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,894
Homer!

154
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,487
I thought I was supposed
to encourage him.

155
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:30,702
I'd like to play me latest chart topper.

156
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:31,703
It's called...

157
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,070
''Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs.''

158
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,407
Bart, you've
got to go on.

159
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,071
Slag off.

160
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,739
You've changed, man.

161
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,147
It used to be about the music.

162
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,685
I said slag off!.

163
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,553
Cool!

164
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,120
Knock it off.

165
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,062
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,430
Knock it off!.

167
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:08,907
I's just jammin'
with ya.

168
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:12,945
Hey, Simpson...

169
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,742
what are you trying
to play?

170
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,407
''Polly-wolly Doodle.''

171
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,748
Oh, yeah? Well, it sounds
Polly-wolly crappy.

172
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,287
Burn.

173
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,787
Hey, cherry ax,
Bart dude.

174
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,417
I think it's broken.

175
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,325
Oh, really? Give it here.

176
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:45,270
I didn't know you played
the guitar, Otto man.

177
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,313
That's all I did
in high school.

178
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,645
My old man said
I was wasting my time...

179
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,775
and I'd never amount
to anything.

180
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,587
I, uh... Hmm.

181
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,819
Now I'd like to slow things down
a little bit.

182
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,635
Although
I'm sure...

183
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,268
I will receive a wedgie
from my bus mates...

184
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,606
I must remind you...

185
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,477
we should have been at school
ten minutes ago.

186
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,574
Uh-oh. Better fasten
your seat belts, little dudes.

187
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,982
We don't have seat belts.

188
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,647
Uh... Well, then
just try to go limp.

189
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,456
Better take a shortcut.

190
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,492
Good show last night.

191
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,498
Yeah, quite good.

192
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,975
Good Lord! Did anyone
get the license number?

193
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,982
- Gee, I forgot.
- Uh, no.

194
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,623
Yay!

195
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,421
Whee!

196
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,023
<i>It's a miracle...</i>

197
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,427
no one was hurt.

198
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,089
I stand on my record--

199
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,429
1 5 crashes and not
a single fatality.

200
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,435
Let's see
your license, pal.

201
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,300
No can do.
Never got one.

202
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,431
If you need proof
of my identity...

203
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,566
I wrote my name
on my underwear.

204
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,474
Oh, wait--
these aren't mine.

205
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:28,208
Until you get a license
and wear your own underwear...

206
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,807
you are suspended without pay.

207
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:31,976
Who will drive the bus?

208
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,543
I drove an all-terrain vehicle
in Da Nang.

209
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,316
I think I can handle it.

210
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,458
Where's Otto?

211
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:43,292
That's one palindrome you won't
be hearing for a while.

212
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,961
Off we go.

213
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,085
Oh, there's an opening.

214
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,643
Oh, too late.

215
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,983
Nope, nope...

216
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,581
Uh... That would cut it
a little close.

217
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,922
You have to be
more aggressive, sir.

218
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,427
Nonsense.

219
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,987
One of our good citizens
will slow down and wave me in.

220
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,993
Nope.

221
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,268
What's so funny?

222
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,107
I was thinking
about the time...

223
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,443
Homer caught his nose
in the toaster.

224
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,277
We'll watch
the tape tonight.

225
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,181
You got someone
at your window.

226
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,684
My name's Patty.

227
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,345
I'll be testing you.

228
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,049
When you do good,
I use the green pen.

229
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,592
When you do bad,
I use the red pen.

230
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,093
Any questions?

231
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,857
Yeah, one: Have you
always been a chick?

232
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,900
<i>No offense, but you were born
a man, weren't you?</i>

233
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,400
You can tell me.

234
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:56,868
I'm open-minded.

235
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,962
I won't be needing this.

236
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,570
All right!

237
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,116
Yeah!

238
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,445
How did I do?

239
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,748
Well,
you failed every segment...

240
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,345
and misspelled ''bus''
on your application.

241
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,391
Drag.

242
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,356
<i>Let me in.</i>

243
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,723
Let me in!

244
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,990
Shut up!

245
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,171
Hey, Landlord,
some clown changed my locks...

246
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,681
padlocked the door,
and put up an eviction notice.

247
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,511
Yeah. That was me.

248
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,880
You?

249
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,179
Well, uh... Why?

250
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,221
You haven't paid
your rent.

251
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,222
Can I at least
get my stuff?

252
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,781
All I found in there
was a jar of mustard...

253
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,191
<i>and a couple
of old Cycle magazines.</i>

254
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,594
Wow! I had mustard?

255
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,926
Rough day, Apu.

256
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,763
Pump me a squishee
and don't spare the syrup.

257
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:05,931
Perhaps you'd like to try
an experimental flavor of mine--

258
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,871
a delicious chutney squishee.

259
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:08,873
Uh...
Okay.

260
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:14,337
You can really taste
the chutney.

261
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:19,584
Ow!

262
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:20,813
Otto man?

263
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,752
You're living
in a Dumpster?

264
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:24,256
Oh, man, I wish.

265
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,589
Dumpster brand trash bins
are top-of-the-line.

266
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:30,824
This is just a Trash-co
waste disposal unit.

267
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,330
Come home with me.

268
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,196
You can stay in our garage.

269
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,859
A garage!

270
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,029
Somebody up there likes me.

271
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,541
Whoo!

272
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:08,746
Hey.

273
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:10,305
Bart, what's going on?

274
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,247
Mom, I thought...

275
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,409
you might forget...

276
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,248
our conversation
this afternoon...

277
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,754
so I took the precaution
of recording it.

278
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,256
What conversation?

279
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,588
Mom, can Otto live in our garage?

280
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,128
He sure can.

281
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:25,061
Marge, what
were you thinking?

282
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:26,428
That's not my voice.

283
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:27,989
Oh, everybody says that...

284
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,228
when they hear
themselves on tape.

285
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:32,100
I don't understand this.

286
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,969
Why can't you stay
with your parents?

287
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,134
The admiral and I
don't get along.

288
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,474
Please, I've got
nowhere else to go.

289
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:42,480
Forget it-- That line
didn't work for my dad...

290
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,243
and it won't work for you.

291
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,376
Otto's going through
a tough time.

292
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:47,976
Can't he stay
for a while?

293
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:50,249
I know we didn't ask
for this, Homer...

294
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,881
but doesn't the Bible say...

295
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,825
''Whatsoever you do
to the least of my brothers...

296
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:56,327
that you do unto me''?

297
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:58,329
But doesn't the Bible
also say...

298
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:01,764
''Thou shalt not take...
moochers into thy... hut''?

299
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:02,766
Please, Dad?

300
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,166
If you let Otto stay...

301
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:05,966
he'll help around
the house...

302
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:07,801
and chip in a few bucks.

303
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,466
All right, he can stay...

304
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,204
but I get to treat him
like garbage.

305
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,041
Wow, what's the catch?

306
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:16,343
The can of corn costs... 57 ¢!

307
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:19,917
I could sure go
for a can of corn.

308
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:21,044
Otto...

309
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,452
you can't just sit there
watching TV all day.

310
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:24,455
You're right.

311
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:26,389
I should do
a little reading.

312
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,451
<i>Uh, you got any of those
Where's Waldo? books?</i>

313
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:30,757
No.

314
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,560
- Anything from the vampire's
point of view?
- No.

315
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:34,793
Anything where guys...

316
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,062
send in naked pictures
of their chicks?

317
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,797
You should get a job.

318
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,805
The only thing
I was ever good at...

319
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:41,999
was bus driving...

320
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,838
and now I need a piece
of paper to do that.

321
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:46,674
So get that piece of paper.

322
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,008
I tried!

323
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,776
Oh, Lord, how I did try.

324
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,252
Knock it off!.

325
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,016
I can't hear myself think.

326
00:17:58,491 --> 00:17:59,856
<i>I want some peanuts.</i>

327
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,086
That's better.

328
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,890
How come you never play
your guitar anymore?

329
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:05,430
I'll tell you
the truth.

330
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,591
I wasn't good at it,
so I quit.

331
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,259
I hope you're not mad.

332
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,269
Son, come here.

333
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:13,929
Of course I'm not mad.

334
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:17,806
If something's hard to do,
then it's not worth doing.

335
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,710
You just stick that guitar
in the closet...

336
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,771
next to your shortwave radio...

337
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,374
your karate outfit,
and your unicycle...

338
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:27,783
and we'll go inside
and watch TV.

339
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:28,479
What's on?

340
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,954
It doesn't matter.

341
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,148
Open up! Open up!

342
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:35,126
I got to go,
and no fooling.

343
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,354
Hey, Pop-N-Fresh!

344
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,158
You're supposed
to giggle.

345
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,099
Gyyaaagh!!

346
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:47,662
That guy has got to go.

347
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,709
I know how you feel...

348
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:52,801
but he is good
with the kids.

349
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:57,148
So the lady drove faster,
but the strange car...

350
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:59,343
kept banging into her
from behind.

351
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:03,180
So, finally,
she swerved off the road...

352
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:04,314
into the woods...

353
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,880
and lost the other car...

354
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,823
and that's when she realized...

355
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:11,352
the man in the other car
wasn't trying to hurt her.

356
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,591
No-- He was trying
to warn her...

357
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,227
about the ax-wielding maniac
hiding in her back seat!

358
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,931
Did the maniac kill her?

359
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,906
Natch. You know how I know?

360
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:22,565
How?

361
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:23,336
Because...

362
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,911
<i>I was that maniac.</i>

363
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,415
Hey, I was
just kidding.

364
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,179
That's it.
He's out of here.

365
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,413
But we're the only family
he's got.

366
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:39,083
<i>This is not Happy Days,
and he is not the Fonz.</i>

367
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,750
Hey-y-y, Mr. S.

368
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:43,886
Listen, you drain-clogging,
last-cookie-eating...

369
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:45,863
collect-call-getting sponge.

370
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:47,763
I want you
out of my house.

371
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,857
Heavy.

372
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:50,368
What will you do, Otto?

373
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:51,528
Oh, don't worry.

374
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,367
There's plenty
of money out there...

375
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:56,203
for a guy who knows
how to fake his own death.

376
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,537
Before you do that...

377
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,545
maybe you should take
the driving test again.

378
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,046
I can't pass that thing.

379
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,547
I got a zero last time.

380
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:05,447
This time I'm hung over.

381
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:06,610
You can do it.

382
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:08,881
You're the coolest adult
I ever met.

383
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:12,789
Wow. I've never been called
an adult before.

384
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:15,554
I've been tried as one, but...

385
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:17,061
I'll do it.

386
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:22,226
''Alcohol increases
your ability to drive.''

387
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:23,290
False?!

388
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:24,301
Oh, man!

389
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:28,899
I don't know about this,
Bart dude.

390
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,237
Your dad is right.

391
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:31,241
<i>I am a bum.</i>

392
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,175
He didn't call you a bum.

393
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:34,837
He called you a sponge.

394
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:35,846
Sponge?!

395
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:40,218
Does this look like something
a sponge would do?!

396
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:41,378
I'll show him...

397
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:44,014
who's a sponge.

398
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,423
Well, if it isn't
Wee Willy Washout.

399
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,427
- I want to take the test again.
- Why?

400
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,224
So I can staple
my license...

401
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:53,527
to Homer Simpson's
big bald head!

402
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,194
Really? Well, here's
your written test.

403
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:58,861
I'll get you started.

404
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:01,031
''B,'' ''C,'' ''D,''
''A,'' ''B...''

405
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:06,710
Homer had a piece of food
on his face for three days.

406
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:09,539
It wasn't little either.

407
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,378
It was a chicken wing.

408
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,077
Wing!

409
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:14,346
Ooh, what was that?

410
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,409
It doesn't matter.

411
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,353
Let's get some margaritas.

412
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:18,355
I'm buying.

413
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:24,722
Otto!

414
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,857
That's what
my driver's license says.

415
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:37,837
Yes, hail to the bus driver...

416
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,175
bus driver man.

417
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,798
- Shh!
