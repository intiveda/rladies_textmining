1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,474
D'oh!

3
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:31,455
<i>May I offer my condolences
on the untimely passing...</i>

4
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,589
of your Great-aunt Hortense.

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,364
As her only living heirs,
you stand to inherit her entire estate.

6
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:42,771
Poor Aunt Hortense.

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,209
Whoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo.

8
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,440
The only stipulation
is that you spend one night...

9
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,574
in a haunted house.

10
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,950
- Oh. Isn't that somewhat unusual?
- No. It's a standard clause.

11
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,890
Well, luckily, there's
no such thing as ghosts.

12
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:07,731
Yes, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

13
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,077
Best night's sleep
I ever had.

14
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,409
Their tap water
tasted better than ours.

15
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,915
Here you go- $100 each.

16
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,578
The rest goes
to Ann Landers...

17
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,780
as was stipulated
in your aunt's will.

18
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,789
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

19
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,258
I must have continued talking
after you left the office.

20
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,591
I do that sometimes.

21
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,803
<i>Oh, my.</i>

22
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,804
What are you gonna
spend your money on, kids?

23
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,897
There's a special on tacos
down at the Taco Mat-

24
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,602
hundred tacos for $100-
I'm gonna get that.

25
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,272
I'm gonna contribute my money to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

26
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,043
Tacos? Public broadcasting?

27
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,483
I won't have you kids
throwing away your money like that.

28
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,886
You're both coming downtown with me,
and you're gonna put that money in the bank.

29
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,560
Boy, I sure could go for 100 tacos
right about now.

30
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,565
No.

31
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,262
<i>Yes, this should provide adequate
sustenance for the Doctor Who marathon.</i>

32
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,609
<i>You'll feel better
knowing your money's...</i>

33
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,803
- in the hands of professionals.
- "Ook, ook. "

34
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,903
Are you folks ready
to go ape?

35
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,314
- Mom?
- A professional in an ape mask is still a professional.

36
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,750
And you'll find
that saving for your future...

37
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,880
is far more thrilling
than any roller coaster.

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,085
Really? Wow!
I should have started a long time ago.

39
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,594
Mm-hmm. Now fill out
these forms.

40
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,530
I'm sure you'll find them more exciting
than a weekend with Batman.

41
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,102
I got their new
Thrifty Saver savings account.

42
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,604
2.3% annual interest
instead of the normal 2.25.

43
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,140
So a year from now
I'll have an extra nickel.

44
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,870
I got the account where
you get free customized checks.

45
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,709
<i>I chose the Hindenburg
flip-book series. Cool!</i>

46
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,545
Hmm. Checking accounts aren't
really for children, Bart.

47
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,552
No, Mom, I can handle it.

48
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,385
Let's see.
Pay to the order of... Lisa-

49
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,789
One cent, and no cents.

50
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,986
And now the old John Hancock.

51
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:19,064
- There you go.
- Thank you.

52
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,996
<i>A million dollars?</i>

53
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,091
Thanks, Bart.
I owe you one.

54
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,296
That's a post-dated check,
remember.

55
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,737
- Don't cash it till the year 10,000.
- Okay.

56
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,414
Excellent.

57
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,543
As soon as the check clears, I'll let you go.

58
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,586
That's it. No more autographs.
I gotta go.

59
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,254
They're naming a new sandwich
after me at my restaurant.

60
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,855
It's okay, Bart. You can share mine.

61
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,936
Quick! Press against me
while the ink's still wet.

62
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,472
No need. I'm going to get
Krusty's autograph the easy way.

63
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,509
If he wants these 25 cents, he'll have to
endorse the check by signing it on the back.

64
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,977
Then, when my monthly
bank statement comes...

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,139
I'll get the check back,
complete with autograph.

66
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,149
No fuss, no muss.

67
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,012
That's a good plan...

68
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,113
but it won't
impress girls like this.

69
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,784
Ew!

70
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,691
Lisa's autograph.
Apu's autograph.

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Oh, what do you know.
Jimbo's real name is Corky.

72
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,604
And... Krusty.

73
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,732
Hey! "Cayman Islands
Offshore Holding Corporation"?

74
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,613
Krusty was supposed
to sign this.

75
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,080
- Take it back and make him sign it.
- Uh, no, no.

76
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,084
Stamping the back of a check
is perfectly legal, little boy.

77
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,086
Many people do it
to save time.

78
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,588
You see, in this case,
instead of writing out his name...

79
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,525
Krusty has stamped the name of his
Cayman Islands Holding Corporation on the-

80
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,687
Hmm.

81
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,697
Uh, excuse me a minute.

82
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,371
Oh, I'm sorry.

83
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:16,381
I can't divulge information about
that customer's secret, illegal account.

84
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,542
Oh, crap. I shouldn't have said
he was a customer.

85
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,519
Oh, crap! I shouldn't
have said it was a secret.

86
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,558
Oh, crap! I certainly
shouldn't have said it was illegal.

87
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,526
It's too hot today.

88
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,629
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I bought this popcorn fair and square.

89
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,076
Sorry. The bank is-

90
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,237
Oh, kid, gosh.
I meant to tell you-

91
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,578
Turns out that Krusty is one
of the biggest tax cheats in history.

92
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,016
And they nailed him, all thanks to you.

93
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,588
Some might say
you're a hero, kid.

94
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,453
Not me, however.
I love Krusty.

95
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,563
Ladies and gentlemen, Krusty the Clown...

96
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,035
was arrested today
for massive tax fraud.

97
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,766
Krusty's years of tax "avoision"
would never have-

98
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,138
- What the heck is "avoision"?
- "Avoision"- It's a crime.

99
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,541
- Look it up. Would never have-
- "Evasion. " "Evasion. "

100
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,706
I don't say "evasion,"
I say "avoision. "

101
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,716
Would never have
come to light if not...

102
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,911
for a crafty little boy
named Bart Simpson.

103
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,887
Krusty's my hero.
How could I do this to him?

104
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,890
It is a tragedy
for all us kids...

105
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,051
but Bart, you can't
beat yourself up.

106
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,892
Yeah. There'll be enough people
to do that for me at recess tomorrow.

107
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,730
Oh, I can't go to jail!

108
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,535
I got a swanky lifestyle.
I'm used to the best.

109
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,304
Krusty, this is America.
We don't send our celebrities to jail.

110
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,312
We're just going
to garnish your salary.

111
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,473
Garnish my celery?

112
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,482
Please, Krusty. No jokes.

113
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,575
Who's joking?

114
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,745
Oh, I don't know
what you're saying.

115
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,880
It all sounds so crazy to me.

116
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,891
It simply means we'll be taking
part of your salary...

117
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,893
until your debt is repaid.

118
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,020
Say, 75% for 40 years.

119
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,293
- But I don't plan to live that long.
- Oh, better make it 95%.

120
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,630
Oy.

121
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,704
The Internal Revenue Service presents...

122
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,830
<i>Herschel Krustofski's
Clown-Related...</i>

123
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,840
<i>Entertainment Show.</i>

124
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,433
Hey, hey, kids.

125
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,445
Now that the Feds
are calling the shots...

126
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,209
this show's gotta be
a lot more cost-effective.

127
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,216
So we had to cut down on the frills...

128
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,718
like sets, props, costumes
and Sideshow Mel.

129
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,517
But that doesn't mean
we can't have fun.

130
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:43,323
For example, I sure wish somebody
would give me a banana cream pie. Yeah!

131
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,330
Uh-

132
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,525
I guess we can't afford
pies right now.

133
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,726
Well, throw something!

134
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,936
Oh, that corner!

135
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,677
Um, I'll have four Tax Burgers...

136
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,185
one "I.R.S. -wich"-
withhold the lettuce-

137
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,278
three dependent-size sodas...

138
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,289
and a "FICA-ccino. "

139
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:17,124
Fill out schedule "B." You should receive
your burgers in six to eight weeks.

140
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,130
Well, let's see here.

141
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,532
Add schedule "B" to line 53,
take away the-

142
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,094
Hey, Marge, what were your
gambling losses last year?

143
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,106
<i>Seven hundred dollars.</i>

144
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,144
They took my money,
they wrecked my show...

145
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,217
they buried a bunch
of stinking veterans in my family plot...

146
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,047
but at least I still got my memories.

147
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:45,954
Those are locked up safe
in my fabulous mansion.

148
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,323
And now, lot number 66,
a handmade leather suitcase...

149
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,328
carried by
the Krustofski family...

150
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,898
upon their arrival
at Ellis Island in 1902.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,468
A priceless heirloom
and historic piece of"Krustyana. "

152
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,469
- What am I bid?
- Forty cents.

153
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,471
I got 40 cents.

154
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,579
Sold, for 40 cents.

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,841
Forty cents?

156
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,917
My grandpa Zev would
turn over in his grave...

157
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,918
if it wasn't filled
with some veteran.

158
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,615
Lot 67, 32 cartons
of pornography.

159
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,623
- Ten cents.
- Twelve.

160
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,955
Twelve cents to our phone bidder
in Japan. Any other bids?

161
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:26,225
All I brought is a dime.
I didn't know there'd be pornography.

162
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,359
- Sold, for 12 cents.
- Oh, my beloved pornography.

163
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,369
I can't watch this anymore.

164
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,962
- I'm going to bed.
- How much for Krusty's bed?

165
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,598
- Half a buck.
- Sold!

166
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,802
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night, Moe.

167
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,714

- But I love that plane.</i>

169
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,885
I used to fly to Vegas in it
with Dean Martin.

170
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,889
One night he looked
out the window...

171
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,221
and the moon hit his eye
like a big pizza pie.

172
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,727
We wrote a song about it...

173
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,696
but it ended up infringing
on one he recorded years before.

174
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,893
Hey, Selma, that plane would
go great with your new suitcase.

175
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,232
Nah, I just bought it
to soak my feet in.

176
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,074
Krusty? Hi. Is it okay
if I sit down here?

177
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,812
Aah. Go ahead, kid.
Knock yourself out.

178
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,480
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've caused you, Krusty...

179
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,489
but you know,
my mom says...

180
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,116
God never closes a door
without opening a window.

181
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,752
No offense, kid,
but your mom's a dingbat.

182
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,093
There's no silver lining here.

183
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,691
I was a big cheese-
a huge cheese!

184
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,702
But now look at me.

185
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,102
I gotta ride the bus like a schnook.

186
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,437
I gotta live in an apartment like an idiot.

187
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,443
I gotta wait in line with nobodies...

188
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,013
to buy groceries from a failure!

189
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,447
It doesn't matter how you live
or what you did wrong.

190
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,576
As long as you're on TV,
people will respect you.

191
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,587
Respect? Pah!

192
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,715
What good is respect
without the moola to back it up?

193
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,056
Everywhere I go
I see teachers in Ferraris-

194
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,063
research scientists
drinking champagne.

195
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,065
I tried to drink
a Coke on the bus...

196
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,567
<i>and they took away my pass.</i>

197
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,900
That's no life
for a famous clown.

198
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,905
Well, if it'll make you
feel any better, Krusty...

199
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,907
you can punch me in the face.

200
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,244
Nah, forget it.
Go home, kid.

201
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,419
<i>Shiva H. Vishnu!</i>

202
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,786
<i>Where is that noise coming from?</i>

203
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,191
I must say,
I've had a lovely evening, Agnes.

204
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,789
<i>I don't suppose
I could come in for a cup of-</i>

205
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,529
- Seymour!
- Mother. Superintendent Chalmers!

206
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,936
- Skinner!
- What I wouldn't give for something...

207
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,474
to interrupt this awkward moment.

208
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,603
That'll do nicely.

209
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,445
- You gotta hand it to Krusty.
- Yeah.

210
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,716
Even with all his problems,
he's still willing...

211
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,724
to do something
unbelievably dangerous...

212
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,817
just to entertain his fans.

213
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,828
Wow.

214
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,731
Oh, that's my Krusty.
I got a feeling he'll be all right.

215
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,944
Oh, my God!
Krusty's shoes!

216
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,242
Okay, folks, show's over.
Nothing to see here.

217
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,579
Show's-
Oh, my God!

218
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,585
A horrible plane crash!

219
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,087
Hey, everybody, get a load
of this flaming wreckage.

220
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,714
Come on, crowd around. Crowd around.
Don't be shy. Crowd around.

221
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,396
Ladies and gentlemen...

222
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,966
Krusty the Clown is dead.

223
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,438
- I can't believe Krusty's really gone.
- Don't worry, son.

224
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,945
I'm sure he's up
in heaven right now...

225
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,709
laughing it up with all
the other celebrities-

226
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:09,186
John Dillinger, Ty Cobb,
Joseph Stalin.

227
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,779
I wish I were dead.

228
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,392
We're gathered
to mourn the passing...

229
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,485
of Herschel Schmoeckel Krustofski...

230
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,894
beloved entertainer
and dear friend.

231
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,899
Hello. I'm Troy McClure.

232
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,196
You might remember me
from such show business funerals...

233
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,567
as "Andre the Giant,
We Hardly Knew Ye"...

234
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,903
and "Shemp Howard:
Today We Mourn a Stooge. "

235
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,739
Now, Krusty's closest friend
and sidekick...

236
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,245
Sideshow Mel.

237
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,747
I'll miss you, Krusty-

238
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,818
I and all
the other Sideshows-

239
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,410
<i>except Sideshow Bob.</i>

240
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,046
<i>But, in the midst of our sorrow...</i>

241
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,921
we can take comfort in the fact
that your elevated blood-alcohol level...

242
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,427
probably helped you burn up quicker.

243
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,589
Since you left us no earthly remains...

244
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,465
it is my sad duty to unveil
this simple memorial.

245
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,842
Next in our cavalcade of
celebrity mourners- Bob Newhart.

246
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,547
Uh-
See, uh-

247
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,515
To tell you the truth, I'm, uh-

248
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,882
I was just-
I'm just killing time here.

249
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,887
I was waiting for a...

250
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,048
well, a different-
different funeral to start.

251
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,719
I'll handle it.
Bob Newhart, everybody!

252
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,398
Oh, uh-

253
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,060
Although, you know-
Though I started my career...

254
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,731
several years before Krusty, so...

255
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,138
you know, I could never
really have learned anything...

256
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,143
directly from him...

257
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,577
still, I think, in a way-

258
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,944
in a very meaningful way-

259
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,745
that, uh- that I- uh- uh-
all of us-

260
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:50,583
have, uh- have learned from him.

261
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,591
You know, that is, by being,
uh, on television for-

262
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,423
for- for so many years.

263
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,588
Even- Even though...

264
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,598
you know, m-many of us, we-

265
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,691
we didn't-
we didn't watch his show.

266
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,169
Th-Thank you.

267
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,176
Well, that's the funeral, folks.

268
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,714
We'll be sitting shivah at the Friar's Club
at 7:00 p. m., and again at 10:00.

269
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,648
You must be over 18 for the 10:00.
It gets a little blue.

270
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,294
And so, Herschel Krustofski...

271
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,386
is gone, but not forgotten.

272
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,556
Today was the unveiling
of the new Krusty stamp.

273
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,760
Postal patrons were asked to choose
between two competing designs-

274
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,565
one of Krusty's
heartwarming smile...

275
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,163
and one of his fiery death.

276
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,471
By a nearly two-to-one vote,
the smiling Krusty was chosen.

277
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,244
Don't let Krusty's death
get you down, boy.

278
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,846
People die all the time...

279
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,858
just like that.

280
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,088
Why, you could
wake up dead tomorrow.

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,955
Well, good night.

282
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,706
Krusty!

283
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,210
Mom! I just saw Krusty!

284
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,872
- Yes, dear, in your mind.
- No, on the street.

285
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,678
- On the street in your mind.
- Why won't you believe me?

286
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,252
Sweetheart, maybe you just
want Krusty to be alive so badly...

287
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,383
you think you see him
everywhere.

288
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,627
I went through the same thing
when Lyndon Johnson died.

289
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,458
<i>And these pills
will help with the queasiness.</i>

290
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,335
Krusty? Dr. Hibbert, who was that man?

291
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,461
Now, Bart, telling you...

292
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,563
would violate
the patient-doctor privilege...

293
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:53,577
just as if I were to tell you that
Jasper here has five seconds to live.

294
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,204
- What'd he say?
- He said I'm next.

295
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,713
Am I going crazy?
I'm seeing Krusty everywhere.

296
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,563
Bart, you're seeing
Krusty everywhere...

297
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,031
because you want to tell him
you're sorry for causing his death.

298
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,035
Would it help if I told you
you're not responsible...

299
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,662
- for Krusty's death?
- Yes. Yes, it would.

300
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,708
Well, I can't. You'll just have to learn
to live with your mental problem.

301
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,744
Wait a minute. All those things I saw-
there's a connection.

302
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,745
The truck full
of nets and buckets...

303
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,008
the queasy guy, the lobsters-

304
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,744
They all point to one thing.
Follow me.

305
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,392
Arr! I've got some customers.

306
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,757
Call me back, Ishmael.

307
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,921
Ahoy there, minnows.

308
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,100
Ahoy. Have you seen this man?

309
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,694
Arr! That's Handsome Pete.
He dances for nickels.

310
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,070
Pete, ye got some customers.

311
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,178
No, we're looking for this man-
Krusty the Clown.

312
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,947
Hmm. N'arr, n'arr, n'arr.

313
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,522
It's hopeless, Bart. We've searched
up and down these docks...

314
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,717
from pier one
to that Pier 1 by pier 17.

315
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,996
<i>Lisa, look-a signature
with stars around it, just like Krusty's.</i>

316
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,333
"Rory B. Bellows, slip eight. "
Let's go!

317
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:34,002
Not a quarter!
Arr! He'll be dancing for hours.

318
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,708
- Are you Rory B. Bellows?
- Yes.

319
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:45,722
- How about Krusty the Clown?
- Sorry. I don't do impressions.

320
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,157
Well, if you're not Krusty, how come
you have the exact same signature as him?

321
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,161
I'm Rory Bellows, I tell you...

322
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,163
and I got a lot of
corroborating evidence...

323
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,597
over here...

324
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,635
by the throttle!

325
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,168
You know,
you two could have said something...

326
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,677
instead of letting me
make an ass of myself.

327
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,304
Hey, you got a pacemaker scar,
just like Krusty.

328
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,315
And Krusty's
superfluous third nipple.

329
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,547
Can't you see I don't want
to be Krusty anymore?

330
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,183
- That's why I faked my death.
- But we saw your plane crash.

331
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,261
Yeah, but I wasn't in it.

332
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:27,128
<i>Just before I hit
the mountain, I jumped out of the plane...</i>

333
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:31,862
<i>into a carefully placed net.</i>

334
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,098
Now that we've blown your cover, I guess
you gotta come back and do your show again.

335
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,300
Or kill us.

336
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,309
I won't be coming back, kids.

337
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,311
I got a sweet life here.

338
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,313
The sea air is clearing
my lungs...

339
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,645
the sun is toasting
my pale skin a healthy brown...

340
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,915
and most important, I learned
that I don't need money to be happy.

341
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,422
<i>All that high living
just distracted me...</i>

342
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,051
from my true calling in life-
salvaging sunken barges...

343
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,391
for scrap iron.

344
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,728
Sorry, kids. There's nothing left
for me on dry land anymore.

345
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,892
But Krusty, what about
all the kids who depend on you...

346
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,027
to brighten up
their afternoons?

347
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,335
<i>- Are you gonna turn your back on them?
- Yes!</i>

348
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,908
Come on, Lise. Krusty doesn't
want our attention anymore.

349
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,074
Let's go worship somebody
who has the guts to be a celebrity.

350
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,084
Yeah. Krusty doesn't
want to be a clown.

351
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,417
He's happy just being
another blue-collar bozo.

352
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,956
Meh!

353
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,958
Krusty's tired
of having phonies around...

354
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,960
pretending to be his friends.

355
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,589
I'm sure he'll find plenty of people
who'll like him for who he is.

356
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,600
Uh, it could happen.

357
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,693
Aw, who needs friends?

358
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,272
The incessant beep
of the global positioning system...

359
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,864
is all the companionship I need.

360
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,442
Tell me where you are now,
you bastard!

361
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:54,576
All right, I admit it.
I miss the phonies.

362
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,586
That's all I miss-

363
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,851
that and ShirleyJones's and Marty Ingels's
New Year's Eve party.

364
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,792
What about that great feeling you get from
knowing you're better than regular people?

365
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,557
What about being an illiterate TV clown...

366
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,395
who's still more respected
than all the scientists...

367
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,402
doctors and educators
in the country put together?

368
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,072
Yeah! I'm not gonna let those guys
hog all the respect...

369
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,942
while I'm out here on some stinkin' tub.

370
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,312
That's just what
those eggheads want.

371
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,386
Well, forget it, poindexter,
'cause Krusty's back in town!

372
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,387
Yea!

373
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,256
So, Krusty, what are you gonna do
about your tax problem?

374
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,265
Don't sweat it.

375
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,528
The life of Rory B. Bellows
is insured...

376
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,571
for a surprisingly large amount.

377
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,961
Shh!
