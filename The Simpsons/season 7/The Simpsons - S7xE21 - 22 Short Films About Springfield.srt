00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,445
D'oh!

3
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,700
Milhouse, do you ever think about
the people in those cars?

4
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,669
I try not to.
It makes it harder to spit on 'em.

5
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,673
Sometimes I wonder
about all the people in this town.

6
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,005
Do you think anything interesting
ever happens to 'em?

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,273
I mean, there must be thousands
of great stories out there.

8
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,744
What do you think, Milhouse?

9
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:59,814
- Milhouse.
- Huh? Oh. Sorry. I saw a convertible.

10
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,019
- You were saying?
- Forget it.

11
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,790
Come on. It's 11:00.
I need some sugar.

12
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,793
I wish you'd come to my party, Apu.
You could use some merriment.

13
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,568
Listen. Serving the customer
is merriment enough for me.

14
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,643
<i>Thank you. Come again.</i>

15
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,644
You see? Most enjoyable.

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,544
Oh, I guarantee a wingding
of titanic proportions.

17
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,640
You will be there
or kindly be square.

18
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,845
Well, I don't like to
leave the store, but...

19
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,386
for the next five minutes I'm going to party
like it's on sale for 19.99.

20
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,532
Quick, quick. No time to cook them.
They will plump in my stomach.

21
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,737
Whoo. Hello, beautiful.

22
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,212
<i>- No ring, I see. So you are
only arranged to be married.</i>

23
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,715
Ooh, ooh, ooh! I love this song.
Let us boogie.

24
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,253
Whoo. I am hot.
Let us get out of here.

25
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,596
Don't worry. I'll tell everybody
you were untouchable.

26
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,597
Whoa.

27
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,190
Whoo!

28
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:19,931
Well, Sanjay, never have I partied
so hearty. Same time next year, yeah?

29
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,507
Yes!

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,476
Made it.
And with one minute to spare.

31
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:31,312
You took four minutes of my life,
and I want them back.

32
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,578
Oh, I'd only
waste 'em anyway.

33
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,658
Swing Serenade is brought
to you by Gorman's ear guards.

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,660
Guard your ears!

35
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,662
With Gorman's.

36
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,291
Mom, Dad threw his beer can
at the Miracle-Gro guy on TV.

37
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,528
- Can I recycle it?
- Why not?

38
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,179
There's gum in my hair!

39
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,411
- Mom! Someone threw gum in my hair!
- Are you sure?

40
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,180
Maybe it's just shampoo.
That washes right out.

41
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,621
No. It's somebody's
gross gum!

42
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,022
Get it out! Ow!

43
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,755
Ow! It's pulling out
my hair.

44
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:21,323
Wait. If I remember my Heloise,
the trick to getting out gum...

45
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,334
is peanut butter.

46
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,707
There. Now, that gum
should lift right out.

47
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,437
Ow.

48
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,845
Maybe it needs a little mayonnaise
to get going.

49
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,851
Okay. You go sit in the sun
and let it melt in.

50
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,387
<i>Hmph. Why me?</i>

51
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,753
Yuck. I smell like a sandwich.

52
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,343
Smithers, what's the meaning of
this slacking off?

53
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,847
There's a bee in my eye, sir.

54
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,578
- And?
- I- I'm allergic to bee stings.

55
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,916
They cause me to, uh, die.

56
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,922
But we're running out of
forward momentum.

57
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,255
Uh, perhaps you could pedal
for just a little while, sir.

58
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,387
Quite impossible.
I can try to bat him off if you like.

59
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:29,093
Uh, really, that's o-

60
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,102
Holy cats, man.
We're starting to wobble.

61
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,163
Get me to a hospital.

62
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,971
You have to pedal.

63
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,637
Oh, "tuddle" Sunday trousers.

64
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,079
Fear not. I'll get you
to a hospital-

65
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,116
the only way I know how.

66
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:49,780
Smithers, you infernal ninny. Stick your
left hoof on that flange now!

67
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,084
Now, if you can get it through
your bug-addled brain...

68
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,957
jam that second mephitic clodhopper
of yours on the right doodad.

69
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,691
Now pump those scrawny chicken legs,
you stuporous funker!

70
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,036
One more jostle,
you wretched shirk-a-day.

71
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,734
Help me.

72
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,043
Holy smokes!
You need booze.

73
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:24,082
- Hi, everybody!
- Hi, Dr. Nick.

74
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,217
Dr. Nick, this malpractice committee has
received a few complaints against you.

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,525
Of the 160 gravest charges,
the most troubling are:

76
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,123
performing major operations with a knife
and fork from a seafood restaurant-

77
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,225
But I cleaned them
with my napkin.

78
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,804
misuse of the cadavers-

79
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,965
I get here earlier when I drive
in the car pool lane.

80
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,509
There's a crazy man
with a scalpel in E.R.!

81
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,671
He's demanding
to see a quack.

82
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,922
Hi, everybody.
Now, tell Dr. Nick where is the trouble.

83
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,492
I'm edgy.
I got ants in my pants.

84
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,357
I'm discombobulated!
Get me a calmative!

85
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:07,661
Slow down, sir.
You're going to give yourself skin failure.

86
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:12,636
Okay. Now, the symptoms
you describe point to "bonus eruptus. "

87
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:18,109
It's a terrible disorder where the skeleton tries
to leap out the mouth and escape the body.

88
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,111
Now you're talkin'.

89
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,740
Our one chance is
"transdental electromicide. "

90
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,149
I'll need a golf cart motor
with a 1,000-volt "capacimator," stat!

91
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,153
Doctor, I can't
in good conscience-

92
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,155
Aaah!
Now there's no time, man!

93
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,817
We'll have to improvise.

94
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,828
<i>- Oh.
- Keep doing that every five seconds.</i>

95
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,595
<i>Dr. Nick, we owe you an apology.</i>

96
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,570
- Consider the charges dropped.
- All right!

97
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,936
Free nose jobs for everybody!

98
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,238
<i>- Ay.! You first.
- Give me a Van Heflin.</i>

99
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:05,285
Say, uh, Barn, uh, remember when I said I'd have
to send away to NASA to calculate your bar tab?

100
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,088
Oh, yeah. We all had a good laugh, Moe.

101
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,789
The results came back today.

102
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,298
You owe me $70 billion.

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,300
- Hmm.
- No. Wait, wait, wait.

104
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,498
<i>That's for the Voyager spacecraft.
Um, your tab's $14 billion.</i>

105
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,938
Well, alls I got is 2,000 bucks.

106
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,566
Well, that's halfway there.

107
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,110
Ha. Freeze, dude. Move a muscle
and I'll blow this wino's head off.

108
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,551
I'm behind three inches
of bulletproof glass. Do your worst.

109
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,753
All right.

110
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,889
No. Stay out of there.
Stay out of there! Oh! Good God, no!

111
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:54,163
Ho! Good-bye student loan payments.
Ha, ha!

112
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,106
Come back here, you stinkin'-

113
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,440
Hey. I wonder
how much air is in here.

114
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,846
Well, Seymour, I made it-
despite your directions.

115
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,856
Ah. Superintendent Chalmers.
Welcome.

116
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,155
- I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon.
- Yeah.

117
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,367
Oh, egads!
My roast is ruined.

118
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,802
But what if...

119
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,807
I were to purchase fast food
and disguise it as my own cooking?

120
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,912
Delightfully devilish, Seymour.

121
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,482
Ah-

122
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,019
<i>Skinner
with his crazy explanations</i>

123
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,181
<i>The superintendent's
gonna need his medication</i>

124
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,657
<i>When he hears Skinner's
lame exaggerations</i>

125
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,194
<i>There'll be trouble
in town tonight</i>

126
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,321
Seymour!

127
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,128
Superintendent, I was just-
uh, just stretching my calves on the windowsill.

128
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,260
Isometric exercise.
Care to join me?

129
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,896
Why is there smoke coming out of
your oven, Seymour?

130
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,033
Uh- Oh. That isn't smoke.
It's steam.

131
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:08,204
Steam from the steamed clams we're having.
Mmm. Steamed clams.

132
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,117
Whew.

133
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,250
Superintendent, I hope you're ready for
mouthwatering hamburgers.

134
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,984
I thought we were having
steamed clams.

135
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:24,256
D'oh, no. I said steamed hams.
That's what I call hamburgers.

136
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,854
You call hamburgers
steamed hams?

137
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,025
Yes. It's a regional dialect.

138
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,593
- Uh-huh. Uh, what region?
- Uh, upstate New York.

139
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:37,836
Really. Well, I'm from Utica, and I've never
heard anyone use the phrase "steamed hams. "

140
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,310
Oh, not in Utica. No.
It's an Albany expression.

141
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,643
I see.

142
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,809
You know, these hamburgers are quite similar
to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.

143
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,819
Oh, no.

144
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,947
Patented Skinner burgers.
Old family recipe.

145
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,323
- For steamed hams.
- Yes.

146
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,296
Yes. And you call them steamed hams despite
the fact that they are obviously grilled.

147
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,593
<i>Ye-</i>

148
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,669
You know, the-

149
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,397
One thing I should-

150
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,837
- Excuse me for one second.
- Of course.

151
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,206
Well, that was wonderful.

152
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,336
A good time was had
by all. I'm pooped.

153
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,383
Yes. I should be- Good Lord!
What is happening in there?

154
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,679
- Aurora borealis.
- Uh-

155
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,880
Aurora borealis
at this time of year...

156
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,857
at this time of day
in this part of the country...

157
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,655
localized entirely
within your kitchen?

158
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,560
- Yes.
- May I see it?

159
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,223
No.

160
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,700
<i>Seymour.! The house is on fire.!</i>

161
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,771
No, Mother. It's just
the northern lights.

162
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,272
Well, Seymour,
you are an odd fellow...

163
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,809
but I must say
you steam a good ham.

164
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,008
<i>Help.! Help.!</i>

165
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,017
"Helms calls for
doughnut tax. "

166
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,925
There. Done and done.

167
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:18,140
<i>Oh.! Why did I have to stop at the railroad tracks?
Better get some change.</i>

168
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,604
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm back.

169
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,342
See? Daddy's here.

170
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,448
Come on, Maggie.
Maybe if you just squeeze a little.

171
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,718
That's it. That's it. I-

172
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,487
D'oh!

173
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,498
<i>Okay, okay. Think, Homer.</i>

174
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,329
<i>The dog.</i>

175
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,373
Okay. Go, boy!
Go find help.

176
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,538
Go find help, boy.

177
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,412
No! Bad dog! Bad dog!

178
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,047
Oh. Don't worry, Maggie.
I'll think of something.

179
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,956
<i>Who's that little baby?</i>

180
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,266
You know, I went to the McDonald's
in, uh, Shelbyville on Friday night.

181
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,639
- The Mc-what?
- Uh, McDonald's restaurant.

182
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,645
I- I never heard of it
either, but, uh...

183
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,581
- they have over 2,000 locations in this state alone.
- Must have sprung up overnight.

184
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,619
You know the funniest thing though?
It's the little differences.

185
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,281
- Example.
- Well, at McDonald's you can buy a Krusty Burger with cheese.

186
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,756
But they don't call it
a Krusty Burger with cheese.

187
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,296
- Get out. Well, what do they call it?
- A Quarter Pounder with cheese.

188
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,921
Quarter Pounder with cheese?

189
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,500
Well, I can picture
the cheese, but, uh-

190
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,129
Do they have Krusty partially gelatinated
nondairy gum-based beverages?

191
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,332
Mm-hmm.
They call 'em shakes.

192
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,137
"Shakes. " You don't know what you're gettin'.

193
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,042
Well, I know what I'm gettin'-
some doughnuts.

194
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,410
Uh, help me out of
the booth, boys.

195
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,199
<i>Ay. Que día miserable
a trabajo.</i>

196
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,302
Primero, el ataque
del "woodpeckero" loco.

197
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,674
Luego, un "desastro"
de electricidad.

198
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,749
E finalmente, una "catástrofía"
con una pelota de baseball.

199
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,826
<i>Tiempo para "relaxar"en paz y quieto.</i>

200
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,558
<i>Ay.!: Naranjas en la cabeza.!</i>

201
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,335
<i>Whoa!</i>

202
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,473
<i>Ay.!: Una "candelabra"
"precariosa".!</i>

203
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,755
<i>No, no, no, no, no.!</i>

204
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,521
<i>Ay. Dónde está mi tequila?</i>

205
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,237
Doughnuts
I got doughnuts, I got-

206
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,240
Hey. I know you.

207
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,417
Hey, hey. Wait up.
We gotta swap insurance info.

208
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,212
Hey!

209
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,017
Hey.

210
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,287
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

211
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,294
<i>Whoa!</i>

212
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:02,663
Hold it right there. Looks like the spider
caught himself a couple of flies.

213
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,044
Come on, boy.
This is the spot right here.

214
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,944
That's a good boy.
Good boy.

215
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,609
Do your dirty,
sinful business.

216
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,620
Howdy, Reverend Lovejoy.
Nice to see you there...

217
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,520
on my lawn with...
your dog.

218
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,820
Oh. Uh, oh.
Bad dog.

219
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,862
Look at that.
Right on Ned's lawn.

220
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,863
Now, how could you do
such a thing?

221
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,899
Good boy.
Don't stop now. Bad dog!

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,596
- I condemn you to hell.
- Better get the old snow shovel back from Homer, huh?

223
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,971
Good boy.
Don't stop the music.

224
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,579
Marge Simpson. Still making juice
the old-fashioned way?

225
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,581
No. I've got gum
in my hair.

226
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,583
Oh, we've tried everything.

227
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,983
Olive oil, lemon juice,
tartar sauce, chocolate syrup...

228
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,783
gravy, bacon fat,
hummus and baba ghanoush.

229
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,222
My scalp hurts
from horsefly bites.

230
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,851
Why don't you freeze it with an ice cube
and hit it with a hammer?

231
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,591
- Works for me when I get bubbly gum in the old push broom.
- That sounds okay.

232
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,862
Aaah! Aaah!

233
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,335
- Stop! Stop!
- Hmm.

234
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,202
I seem to have mashed
more hair into it. Oh, well.

235
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,243
<i>Ice cubes are useless, man.
Chewing gum's got to be chewed out.</i>

236
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,779
Does the whole town
have to hear about this?

237
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,644
Arr! Have ye tried
a Baltic squid?

238
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,015
They can suck the bolts
out of a submarine's hull.

239
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,887
<i>All right! Fangoria will give me
25 bucks for this shot.</i>

240
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,655
I can give you the name of
a good gum and hair man.

241
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,425
I have a word of advice.
Don't try to dig gum out with a bone.

242
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,466
It just makes things worse.

243
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:46,026
Leave it in as evidence.
Bazooka Joe's got deep pockets.

244
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:50,097
Perhaps I can help. My papa is foreman
of the Düsseldorf Gum Works.

245
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,518
<i>Some folk'll never eat a skunk
but then again some folk'll</i>

246
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,717
<i>Like Cletus
the Slack-Jawed Yokel</i>

247
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,327
Hey. What's goin' on on this side?

248
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,094
Hey, Brandine. You might could wear
these to your job interview.

249
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,726
And scuff up
the topless dancin' runway?

250
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,603
- Nah. You best bring 'em back where from you got 'em.
- Okay.

251
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,006
Back you go...

252
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,602
to waits for a woman
of less discriminatin' tastes.

253
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,051
<i>Most folk'll never lose a toe
and then again, some folk'll</i>

254
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:40,387
<i>Like Cletus

255
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,161
Hey. You know what?

256
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,289
I could call my ma
while I'm up here.

257
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,766
Hey, Ma!
Get off the dang roof!

258
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,339
Yes. And one with
extra cheese.

259
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,308
- Thank you.
- C-Can I use your bathroom?

260
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,174
No. You may not.
The bathroom is for paying customers only.

261
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,841
- If you purchase an item, you may use the bathroom.
- Okay.

262
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,350
Um, how about that?

263
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,889
<i>That is a rare photo
of Sean Connery signed by Roger Moore.</i>

264
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,390
<i>- It is worth $ 150.
- What can I get for 75 cents?</i>

265
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,690
<i>You may purchase
this charming Hamburglar Adventure.</i>

266
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,562
A child has already solved theJumble
using crayons. The answer is "fries. "

267
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,567
Uh, Milhouse,
what's going on?

268
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,502
You said you just needed to use the bathroom.
Now I find you buying comics.

269
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,699
Oh, our transaction is completed.
You may take the boy.

270
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,708
Wait!

271
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:43,487
<i>As soon as Zed gets here, the party will begin.</i>

272
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,080
There he is now.

273
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,426
- Who are you?
- Uh, can my son use your bathroom?

274
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,657
- You gotta say yes!
- Okay, but be quick.

275
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,665
It's in back.

276
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,273
Uh, so, uh,
n-nice store.

277
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,682
Uh, you know, when I was a kid this used to be
a pet store.

278
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:15,685
Yeah. Right over there against that wall
there was the cutest little-

279
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,846
<i>Get in the corner.</i>

280
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,192
Hey, Dad.
Can we get this, please?

281
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,561
Oh, my gosh.
Sorry, mister.

282
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,338
Want me to cut off the gum
or just style it?

283
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,071
Cut it off,
but be careful.

284
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,981
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I know how important hair is to a little girl.

285
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:54,354
You keep squirming, there's going to be
a little bald girl with no lollipop.

286
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,393
I love it.

287
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,623
I finally look like
a real person. Thanks.

288
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,659
Ha-ha!

289
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,102
Ha-ha!

290
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,338
Ha-ha!

291
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,047
Crud.

292
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,652
<i>- He's down there.
- Crud.!</i>

293
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,856
Do you find something comical
about my appearance...

294
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,696
- when I am driving my automobile?
- Yeah.

295
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,431
Everyone needs to drive
a vehicle- even the very tall.

296
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,975
This was the largest auto
that I could afford.

297
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,102
Should I therefore be made
the subject of fun?

298
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,511
- I guess so.
- Wh- He-

299
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,518
Would you like it
if I laughed at your misfortune?

300
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,282
Huh? Maybe we should find out.

301
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,119
Now march.

302
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,258
Hey, everybody. Look at this.

303
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,232
It's that boy
who laughs at everyone.

304
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,199
Let's laugh at him.

305
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,237
Ha-ha!

306
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,796
Wave to the people.

307
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,671
Blow them kisses.

308
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:34,918
Well, Milhouse, I guess interesting stuff
does happen to people in Springfield.

309
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:39,157
Yep. Everybody in town's
got their story to tell.

310
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,700
There's just not
enough time to hear 'em all.

311
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,703
Oh. Sorry I'm late.

312
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,899
There was trouble at the lab with the running
and the exploding and the crying.

313
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,841
One of the monkeys stole
the glasses off my head.

314
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,912
Oh, no, wait.
Please, no. Please.

315
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,746
<i>I have a funny story, if you listen.
I even wrote theme music.</i>

316
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,784
