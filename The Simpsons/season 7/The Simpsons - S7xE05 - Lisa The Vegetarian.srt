<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,508
D'oh!

3
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,567
- Are we there yet?
- No.

4
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,795
- Are we there yet?
- No.

5
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,496
- Are we there yet?
- No.

6
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:43,667
- Where are we going?
- We're going to Storytown Village, Grampa.

7
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,768
It's an amusement park for babies.

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,680
- Oh! Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.
- That's the plan.

9
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,117
I think it's nice we're doing something
Maggie will enjoy for once.

10
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,350
Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village
is also fun for everyone...

11
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,621
from eight to God only knows.

12
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:14,702
Come out. Come out
or I'll blow your house in.

13
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,073
Not by the hairs
on our chinny chin chins.

14
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,612
- What a load of crappy crap crap!
- Quiet, boy.

15
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,341
I have a feeling some bad stuff
is about to go down.

16
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,748
This is where the wolf
blows down the pigs' house.

17
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,218
He blows, all right.
He blows big-time.

18
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,119
That's it, honey.
Get into the spirit.

19
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,827
Uh, it was good,
but not great.

20
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,735
Somebody's been sleeping
in my bed.

21
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,103
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.

22
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,075
Somebody's been sleeping
in my bed.

23
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:55,079
Well, I'm sorry.
But it was a 150 degrees in the car.

24
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,422
So long, su-Aah!

25
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,812
Come on! Eat the can!
Come on!

26
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,179
You're supposed to feed them pellets
from the machine over there.

27
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,287
Huh?

28
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,118
Oh, my!

29
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,743
<i>Out of the way, you.!</i>

30
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,177
Ahhh.

31
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,615
Oh, you are so cute.
Yes, you are. You are.

32
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,709
I just love you.

33
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,551
See? It was a good idea
to come here after all.

34
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,456
<i>Attention, families. This is Mother Goose.</i>

35
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,995
The following cars
have been broken into-

36
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,530
<i>Hmm?</i>

37
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:25,001
<i>Allemande left

38
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,868
<i>Swing your partner

39
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,313
<i>- All rightilly-dightilly.
- Hey, Flanders.</i>

40
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,782
Hidilly-ho, neighboreeno!

41
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,012
- Shut up!
- Okilly-dokilly.

42
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,817
So, Ned, you're having a family reunion
and you didn't invite me?

43
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,552
Oh, gosh, Homer.
This is strictly a Flanders affair.

44
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,685
I got family here
from around the globe.

45
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,959
<i>- Here's José Flanders.
- Buenos ding-dong-diddly-días, senor.</i>

46
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,503
- And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders.
- Charmed.

47
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,973
Eh, a-googilly-doogilly.

48
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:07,206
I can't believe you didn't invite me, after I
painted those cool stripes all over your car.

49
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,771
I know! I'll throw my own barbecue!

50
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,545
The greatest barbecue
this town has ever seen.

51
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,521
<i>And I'll only invite who I want.
That'll show you.</i>

52
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,558
- Can I come?
- Sure. D'oh!

53
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,823
This barbecue will be hard, thankless work.
But I'm sure you're up to it, Marge.

54
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,730
Well, it could be a good chance to get to know
our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting.

55
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,734
You know what
you should serve, Marge?

56
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,634
More of these lamb chops.
These are the best ever.

57
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,639
Why, thank you, Homie.

58
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,609
You might say
the extra ingredient is salt.

59
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,425
Please, Lisa.
I thought you loved me.

60
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,518
Loved me.

61
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,291
What's wrong, Lisa?
Didn't you get enough lamb chops?

62
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,835
I can't eat this.
I can't eat a poor little lamb.

63
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,427
Lisa, get ahold of yourself.
This is "lamb," not "a lamb. "

64
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,007
What's the difference between this lamb
and the one that kissed me?

65
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,008
This one spent
two hours in the broiler.

66
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,045
<i>Bart, sensible bites.!
All right, Lisa.</i>

67
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,412
If you don't want lamb chops,
there's lots of other things I can make.

68
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,850
<i>Chicken breast,
rump roast...</i>

69
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,286
<i>- hot dogs.
- No, I can't!</i>

70
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,790
- I can't eat any of them!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

71
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,057
Lisa, honey, are you saying you're
never going to eat any animal again?

72
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,791
- What about bacon?
- No.

73
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,797
- Ham?
- No.

74
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,458
- Pork chops?
- Dad!

75
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,035
Those all come from the same animal!

76
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,660
Oh, yeah, right, Lisa.

77
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,739
<i>A wonderful, magical animal.</i>

78
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,805
I think Lisa's right, Dad.
Eating meat is ba-a-a-ad.

79
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,677
Hey, that's my chop!

80
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,755
Oh, my family just doesn't understand
my newfound vegetarianism.

81
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,197
Compared to them, the public schools
are a haven of enlightenment.

82
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,861
<i>Okay, class,
time to dissect our worms.</i>

83
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,238
First, pin them down so they don't
fly up and hit you in the eye.

84
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,143
- Um, Miss Hoover?
- Yes, Ralph? What is it?

85
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,911
My worm went in my mouth
and then I ate it. Can I have a new one?

86
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,009
No, Ralph.
There aren't any more.

87
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,453
Just try to sleep
while the other children are learning.

88
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,549
Oh, boy! Sleep!
That's where I'm a Viking.

89
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,197
Lisa, what did I ever do to you-ou-ou?

90
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,233
Why does it talk like a lamb?

91
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:55,104
Uh, Miss Hoover, I don't think I can dissect
an animal. I think it's wrong.

92
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,183
Okay, Lisa.
I respect your moral objection.

93
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,726
Um, excuse me.

94
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,525
- Isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it?
- Possibly the meat loaf.

95
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,931
Well, I believe you're required to
provide a vegetarian alternative.

96
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,604
<i>Yum. It's rich
in bunly goodness.</i>

97
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,836
Do you remember when you lost
your passion for this work?

98
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,579
- Uh-oh. Two independent
thought alarms in one day.

99
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,584
The students are over-stimulated.

100
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,052
Willie, remove all the colored chalk
from the classrooms.

101
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,385
I warned ya!
Didn't I warn ya?

102
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,756
That colored chalk was
forged by Lucifer himself!

103
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,489
<i>The Itchy and Scratchy Show</i>

104
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,067
Mmm!

105
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,282
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

106
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,550
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

107
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,522
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

108
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,593
Mmm!

109
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,164
I never realized before,
but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons...

110
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,209
send the message that violence
against animals is funny.

111
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,835
Say what?
Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa.

112
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,404
They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff,
you know, like people getting hurt and stuff.

113
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,111
- Stuff like that- Ohh!
- Look, kids.

114
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,019
I just got my party invitations
back from the printers.

115
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,751
"Come to Homer's BBBQ.

116
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,226
The extra 'B' is for BYOBB."

117
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,456
- What's that extra "B" for?
- That's a typo.

118
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,160
Dad, can't you have some other kind of party?
One where you don't serve meat?

119
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,294
But all normal people love meat.

120
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:03,501
If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat,
I would say, "Yo, goober! Where's the meat?"

121
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,772
I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa.
You don't win friends with salad.

122
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,779
You don't win friends

00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,781
You don't win friends with salad

124
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,441
You don't win friends

00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,179

00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,050
You don't win

00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,816
<i>You don't win friends with salad</i>

00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,653
You don't win friends with salad

129
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,454
You don't win friends

130
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,394
- You don't win friends with salad
- Mom!

131
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,057
I didn't mean to take sides.
I just got caught up in the rhythm.

132
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,863
Good morning, class.
A certain... agitator-

133
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,201
For privacy's sake,
let's call her Lisa S.

134
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,674
No, that's too obvious.
Uh, let's say L. Simpson-

135
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,839
has raised questions
about certain school policies.

136
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:46,408
So, in the interest of creating an open dialogue,
sit silently and watch this film.

137
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,691
Nothing beats a stroll
in cattle country.

138
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,922
Hi, I'm Troy McClure.

139
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,899
<i>You may remember me from such educational
films as Two Minus Three Equals Negative Fun.!</i>

140
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,904
<i>- And Firecrackers: The Silent Killer.
- Mr. McClure?</i>

141
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,940
- Oh, hello, Bobby.
- Jimmy.

142
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,533
I'm curious as to how meat gets
from the ranch to my stomach.

143
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:16,308
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Jimmy.
You just asked a mouthful.

144
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,975
<i>It all starts here
in the high-density feedlot.</i>

145
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,918
Then when the cattle are just right-

146
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,921
Mmm!

147
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,720
it's time for them to "graduate"
from Bovine University.

148
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,292
Come on, Jimmy.
Let's take a peek at the killing floor.

149
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,631
Don't let the name throw you, Jimmy.

150
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,604
It's not really a floor.
It's more of a steel grating...

151
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,403
that allows material to sluice through
so it can be collected and exported.

152
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,751
Getting hungry, Jimmy?

153
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,387
Uh, Mr. McClure,
I have a crazy friend...

154
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,692
who says it's wrong
to eat meat.

155
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,927
- Is he crazy?
- No, just ignorant.

156
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,472
You see, your crazy friend
never heard of the food chain.

157
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,872
- Just ask this scientician.
- Uh-

158
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:22,346
He'll tell you that in nature one creature
invariably eats another to survive.

159
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,055
Don't kid yourself, Jimmy.

160
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,285
If a cow ever got the chance,
he'd eat you and everyone you care about.

161
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:44,199
Wow, Mr. McClure! I was a Grade A moron
to ever question eating meat.

162
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:48,569
Yes, you were, Jimmy. Yes, you were.

163
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,938
Ow. You're hurting me.

164
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,775
They can't seriously expect us
to swallow that tripe.

165
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,612
Now as a special treat,
courtesy of our friends at the meat council...

166
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,277
please help yourselves to this tripe.

167
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,991
<i>Stop it.!
Stop it.!</i>

168
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,028
Don't you realize you've just been
brainwashed by corporate propaganda?

169
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,225
Apparently, my crazy friend here
hasn't heard of the food chain.

170
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,632
Yeah. Lisa's a Grade A moron.

171
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,366
When I grow up,
I'm going to Bovine University.

172
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,444
Hi, Homer.
Thanks for inviting me to your barbecue.

173
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,038
Whoa, Barney!
You brought a whole beer keg!

174
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,118
Yeah. Where can I fill it up?

175
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,081
<i>Wait, Dad.!
Good news, everyone.!</i>

176
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,715
You don't have to eat meat!
I made enough gazpacho for all!

177
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,419
- I don't like gazpacho.
- What's that anyway?

178
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,622
It's tomato soup served ice cold.

179
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,695
<i>Go back to Russia.</i>

180
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,407
Ah, diagnosis... delicious.

181
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,815
I've got the prescription
for you, Doctor.

182
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,686
Another hot beef injection.

183
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:51,423
Hey, Homer. Bring me another one of them,
uh, burgers, would you?

184
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,489
I can't quite seem to...
stand up under my own power anymore.

185
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,968
One whopper for the copper.

186
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,699
- Another burger, Dad?
- Here you go!

187
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,934
It's bad enough
they're all eating meat.

188
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,238
They don't have to
rub it in my face.

189
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,778
Okay, everybody. It's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

190
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,515
The pig de résistance.

191
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,327
Look at his nose.

192
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,762
Congratulations, Homer.
Your "Q" is a huge success.

193
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,199
Hey, a toast to the host
who can boast the most roast!

194
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,395
Thanks, Flanders.

195
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:37,032
I have to agree that
everything certainly- Huh?

196
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,872
Bart! No!

197
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,538
- What?
- Sorry. Force of habit.

198
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,479
Lisa! No!

199
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,555
<i>Uhh! Ohh!</i>

200
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,431
<i>It's just a little dirty.
It's still good. It's still good.</i>

201
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,131
It's just a little slimy.
It's still good. It's still good.

202
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,882
It's just a little airborne.
It's still good. It's still good.

203
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,716
- It's gone.
- I know.

204
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:29,226
You know, Smithers, I think I'll donate
a million dollars to the local orphanage...

205
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,058
when pigs fly.

206
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,429
- That's a good one. Hey- Hey-
- Wh-Wha-

207
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:40,267
- Will you be donating that million dollars now, sir?
- No. I'd still prefer not.

208
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,278
Give it up, Dad.
Piggy ain't coming back.

209
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,211
Lisa, you ruined my barbecue!

210
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,513
I demand you apologize this second!

211
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,181
I'm never, ever apologizing,
because I was standing up for a just cause!

212
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,258
And you were
wrong, wrong, wrong!

213
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,819
- Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room!
- That's it! Go to your room!

214
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,298
Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa...

215
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,733
would you please ask her
to pass me the syrup?

216
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,772
Please pass your father the syrup, Lisa.

217
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:19,776
Bart, tell Dad I'll only pass the syrup
if it won't be used on any meat product.

218
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,812
You dunking your sausages
in that syrup, homeboy?

219
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:26,317
Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink
a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning.

220
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,114
Tell him yourself.
You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart.

221
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,121
Bart, thank your mother
for pointing that out.

222
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,659
<i>Homer, you're not not talking to me.
And, secondly, I heard what you said.</i>

223
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,990
Lisa, tell your mother
to get off my case.

224
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,257
Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one
you're not talking to.

225
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,890
- Bart, go to your room!
- Why don't you just eat him, Dad?

226
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,731
I don't need any serving
suggestions from you...

227
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,896
you barbecue-wrecking,
know-nothing, know-it-all.

228
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,841
That's it! I can't live in a house
with this prehistoric carnivore!

229
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,006
I am out of here!

230
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,677
That's it!
Go to your room!

231
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,179
Look! It's Mrs. Potato Head.

232
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,416
She has a head made out of lettuce.

233
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,119
I can't believe
I used to go out with you.

234
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,253
Are you gonna marry a carrot, Lisa?

235
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes, I'm gonna marry a carrot.

236
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,033
- She admitted it!
- She admitted she's gonna marry a carrot!

237
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,105
I can't believe it.

238
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,286
Your windows.

239
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,187
Mmm! The next-

240
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,424
The whole world wants me to eat meat!
I can't fight it anymore!

241
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,077
There! Is everybody happy now?

242
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,242
I take it from your yelling
that you like my tofu dogs.

243
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,945
- Tofu?
- Oh, yes. No meat whatsoever.

244
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,522
And only thrice the fat
of a normal hot dog.

245
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:15,081
- I made the switch and nobody noticed.
- But why, Apu?

246
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,925
Because I'm a vegetarian.
Haven't you ever seen my T-shirt?

247
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,596
- That's cute.
- Here. Let me show you something, Lisa.

248
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,805
Wow! A secret staircase.

249
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,469
But what do you do if somebody
wants a nonalcoholic beer?

250
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,547
You know, it's never come up.

251
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,877
<i>Oh, Apu, it's beautiful.</i>

252
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,618
Yes. This is where I come when I need
some refuge from the modern world...

253
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,059
or when I want to see
drive-in movies for free.

254
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,961
I know it is not easy
to be a vegetarian, Lisa.

255
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,502
<i>- That's why I ran away from home.
- What? She's leaving home?</i>

256
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,197
<i>Wow.! Paul McCartney.!</i>

257
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,537
I read about you in history class.
But where's your wife, Linda?

258
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,305
Right here, Lisa.
Whenever we're in Springfield...

259
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,539
we like to hang out
in Apu's garden in the shade.

260
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,947
We met him in India years ago
during the Maharishi days.

261
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:17,078
- Back then I was known as the fifth Beatle.
- Sure you were, Apu.

262
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,989
You know what, Lisa?
Paul and Linda are vegetarians too.

263
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,891
In fact, Linda has her own line
of vegetarian entrees.

264
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,692
Apu, I'm sure the last thing
they want to talk about is-

265
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,767
We weren't satisfied with
the other vegetarian meals on the market.

266
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,269
You'd be surprised how often
you'd find a big hunk of pork in them.

267
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,808
- Ew!
- Linda and I both feel strongly about animal rights.

268
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,276
In fact, if you play
"Maybe I'm Amazed" backwards...

269
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,314
you'll hear a recipe
for a really ripping lentil soup.

270
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,680
When will all those fools learn
that you can be perfectly healthy...

271
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,879
simply eating vegetables, fruits,
grains and cheese?

272
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,617
- Ooh, cheese!
- You don't eat cheese, Apu?

273
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,684
No, I don't eat any food
that comes from an animal.

274
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,788
Oh! Then you must think
I'm a monster.

275
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,833
Yes, indeed, I do think that.

276
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:08,168
But I learned long ago, Lisa, to tolerate others
rather than forcing my beliefs on them.

277
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,106
<i>You know, you can influence
people without badgering them always.</i>

278
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,940
It's like Paul's song,
"Live and Let Live. "

279
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,846
- It was "Live and Let Die. "
- Whatever, whatever. It had a good rhythm.

280
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,320
I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of
people, especially my dad. Thanks, you guys.

281
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,414
Lisa, before you go,
would you like to hear a song?

282
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,586
- Wow! That'd be great!
- Okay. Take it, Apu.

283
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,274
Lisa.

284
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,813
Lisa!

285
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:53,476
Lisa, come back before everyone finds out
what a horrible father I am!

286
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,746
<i>Hi, Dad.
Looking for me?</i>

287
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,982
- I don't know. Were you looking for me?
- I don't know.

288
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,060
Oh, Lisa.
I was looking for you.

289
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,060
I wanted to apologize.

290
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,290
I don't know exactly what went wrong,
but I know it's always my fault.

291
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,299
Actually, Dad,
this time I was wrong-

292
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,301
- Oh.
- too.

293
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,634
While I was gone, I got some really good
advice from Paul and Linda McCartney.

294
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,141
Rock stars. Is there anything
they don't know?

295
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,839
I still stand by my beliefs.
But I can't defend what I did.

296
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,246
I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue.

297
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,878
I understand, honey. I used to
believe in things when I was a kid.

298
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,091
Come on! I'll give you
a piggyback ride- Uh, oops!

299
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,285
I mean,
a veggieback ride home.

300
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,556
Come on.
