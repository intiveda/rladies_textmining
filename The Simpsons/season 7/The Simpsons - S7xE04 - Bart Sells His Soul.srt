00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,202
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,516
D'oh!

3
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,202
Hymns here! I got hymns here!
Get 'em while they're holy!

4
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:42,172
Fresh from God's brain to your mouth!

5
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,506
And now please rise
for our opening hymn...

6
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,638
uh, "In the Garden of Eden"...

7
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,717
by I. Ron Butterfly.

8
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,226
In the garden of Eden, honey

9
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,958
Don't you know that I love you

10
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,468
In the garden of Eden, baby

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,267
Don't you know
that I'll always be true

12
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,249
Hey, Marge, remember
when we used to make out to this hymn?

13
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,284
Shh! Shh! Shh!

14
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,757
Oh, won't ya come with me

15
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:39,798
And take my hand

16
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:40,866
Wait a minute.

17
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,435
This sounds like rock and/or roll.

18
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,663
<i>And walk this land</i>

19
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,179
I know one of you
is responsible for this.

20
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,448
So repeat after me: If I withhold
the truth, may I go straight to hell...

21
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,955
where I will eat naught
but burning-hot coals...

22
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,526
and drink naught
but burning-hot cola.

23
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,118
Where fiery demons
will punch me in the back...

24
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,425
where my soul
will be chopped into confetti...

25
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,727
and strewn upon a parade of murderers
and single mothers...

26
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,326
where my tongue will be
torn out by ravenous birds.

27
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,338
Bart did it!

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,170
- That Bart right there!
- Milhouse!

29
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,471
Milhouse, you did the right thing.

30
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,478
Bart, come with me
for punishment.

31
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,309
You too, snitchy.

32
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,316
<i>I want you to clean
every one of these organ pipes...</i>

33
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,819
that you have befouled
with your popular music.

34
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,021
You shank!
How could you tell on me?

35
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,363
Well, I didn't want hungry birds
pecking my soul forever.

36
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,098
Soul? Come on, Milhouse.
There's no such thing as a soul.

37
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,834
It's just something
they made up to scare kids...

38
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,842
like the boogeyman,
or MichaelJackson.

39
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,310
But every religion says
there's a soul, Bart.

40
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,246
Why would they lie?
What would they have to gain?

41
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,944
I don't hear scrubbing!

42
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,180
If your soul's real, where is it?

43
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,189
It's kinda in here...

44
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,488
and when you sneeze,
that's your soul trying to escape.

45
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,154
Saying "God bless you"
crams it back in...

46
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,164
and when you die
it squirms out and flies away.

47
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,394
Uh-huh. What if you die in a submarine
at the bottom of the ocean?

48
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,403
Oh, it can swim.

49
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,965
It's even got wheels, in case you die in the desert
and it has to drive to the cemetery.

50
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,408
How can someone with glasses that thick
be so stupid?

51
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,345
Listen, you don't have a soul,
I don't have a soul.

52
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,111
- There's no such thing as a soul!
- Fine.

53
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,020
If you're so sure about that,
why don't you sell your soul to me?

54
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,522
How much you got?

55
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,183
- Five bucks.
- Deal.

56
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,030
There you go.
One soul.

57
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,733
Pleasure doing business with you.

58
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,326
Anytime, chum...

59
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,338
p.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,034
All right, where would you kids
like to eat tonight?

61
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,700
The Spaghetti Laboratory!

62
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,711
Face-Stuffers!

63
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,873
Professor V.J. Cornucopia's Fantastic
Foodmagorium and Great American Steakery.

64
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,247
Well, what about this place?

65
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,979
Moe's.

66
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,549
Aah! Natural light!

67
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,558
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,026
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was a family restaurant.

69
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,029
Oh, it is. It is.

70
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,395
Just, uh, pull them stools
up to the pool table.

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,400
Daddy, this place...

72
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,402
smells like tinkle!

73
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,132
Mm-hmm. I think we'll just go
to the Texas Cheesecake Depository.

74
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,641
Everybody is going
to family restaurants these days.

75
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,645
Seems nobody wants to hang out
in a dank pit no more.

76
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,977
You ain't thinkin' of gettin' rid
of the dank, are ya, Moe?

77
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,982
Ahh, maybe I am.

78
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,245
Ah, but, Moe, the dank-
the dank!

79
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,754
Yeah, family restaurants.
That's where the big bucks are.

80
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,220
I could turn this joint into a place...

81
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,727
where you wouldn't be ashamed
to bring your family!

82
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,559
I'm not ashamed.

83
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,634
Hey, put a coaster under that.

84
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,943
Oh, Lisa!

85
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,946
There's a little present for you
lying in the driveway!

86
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,016
Oh, boy! Really?

87
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:29,021
Aaah! No! It's dripping
funny-smelling water all over me!

88
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,338
I wasted five bucks on these.

89
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,931
Where'd you get five bucks?
I want five bucks.

90
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,533
- I sold my soul to Milhouse.
- What?

91
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,206
How could you do that?
Your soul is the most valuable part of you.

92
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,215
You believe in that junk?

93
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,445
Well, whether or not
the soul is physically real, Bart...

94
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,455
it's the symbol
of everything fine inside us.

95
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,185
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Poor, gullible Lisa.

96
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,124
I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks.

97
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,129
Bart, your soul is the only part of you
that lasts forever.

98
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:09,065
For five dollars,
Milhouse could own you for a zillion years.

99
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:13,161
Well, if you think he got such a good deal,
I'll sell you my conscience for 4.50.

100
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,172
I'll throw in
my sense of decency too.

101
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,141
It's a Bart sales event!
Everything about me must go!

102
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,909
Hey, boy. How ya doin'?

103
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,914
Man!
What's gotten into you?

104
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,853
Geez! You're pretty uppity
for someone who eats bugs all day.

105
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,687
Stupid automatic door.

106
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:41,123
Thank you, door!

107
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,674
<i>Some ice cream guy's gonna see that,
and it'll blow his mind.!</i>

108
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,676
Let me try.

109
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,810
Way to breathe, No-Breath.

110
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,618
This is getting weird.

111
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,122
Sanjay, to the entrance
with the Windex.

112
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,756
<i>Sanjay, to the entrance
with the Windex.</i>

113
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,697
So, come on. I need a name that says
friendly, all-American cooking.

114
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,704
How about
Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?

115
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,706
I like it!

116
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,709
Nah. I want something that says people
can have a nice, relaxing time.

117
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,712
I got it!
Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!

118
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,714
I like it!

119
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,047
Hey, how about
Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag?

120
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,052
I hate it.

121
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,749
<i>Oh, boy! The deep fryer's here.</i>

122
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,849
I got it used from the navy.

123
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,520
You could flash-fry a buffalo
in 40 seconds.

124
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,223
Forty seconds?
But I want it now!

125
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,960
The Itchy & Scratchy Show

126
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,118
Ah!

127
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,186
I know that's funny,
but I'm just not laughing.

128
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,451
Hmm. Pablo Neruda said laughter
is the language of the soul.

129
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,459
I am familiar with the works
of Pablo Neruda.

130
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,426
I think we should do a test.

131
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,200
D'oh!

132
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,138
Help! Help!

133
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,143
- Somebody help me! I'm stuck in a banister!
- Well?

134
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,645
- Nope. I don't feel a thing.
- That's creepy, Bart.

135
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,649
- I think you really did lose your soul.
- Good boy!

136
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,413
Ow! Ow! Who's doing that?

137
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,420
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

138
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,422
Ow! Help me! Ow!

139
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,220
Why isn't anybody- Ow!
helping?

140
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,396
Hi. Is Milhouse home?

141
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,399
He's playing in the dirt
with his army men.

142
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,163
<i>Oh, and a white piece of paper, I believe.</i>

143
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,070
Cover me, Sarge.
I'm going after Bart's soul.

144
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,771
If the ayatollah can't have it,
no one can!

145
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,711
- Uh, you know, Milhouse-
- Ye-e-e-es?

146
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,185
- Bet you're gettin' tired of that soul, huh?
- No!

147
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,189
Well, suppose someone
wanted to buy it from you.

148
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,953
Oh.
You wanna buy it back, Bart?

149
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,961
Sure. No problem.

150
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,031
- Fifty bucks.
- What?

151
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,259
Who's stupid now, huh?

152
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,766
If you like good food, good fun...

153
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,277
and a whole lot of
crazy crap on the walls...

154
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,076
then come on down
to Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag.

155
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,812
At Moe's, we serve good,
old-fashioned home cooking...

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,013
deep-fried to perfection.

157
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,419
Now, that's "Moe" like it!

158
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,052
So bring the whole family-
mom, dad, kids.

159
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,723
Uh, no old people.
They're not covered by our insurance.

160
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,165
It's fun!
And remember our guarantee.

161
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:40,967
If I'm not smiling when your check comes,
your meal's on me- Uncle Moe!

162
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,065
Come to Uncle Moe's for family fun

163
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,543
It's good, good, good, good
Good-good-good

164
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,581
Mmm! Sounds good.

165
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,519
Mmm!

166
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,148
Hmm. Bart, what's wrong? There's
something a little off about your hug.

167
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,591
Mom, I need to tell you something.
I kind of-

168
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,630
Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Let me guess.
A mother can always tell.

169
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,631
Mm-mmm.

170
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,600
Hmm. It's not fear
of nuclear war.

171
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,466
Mm-mmm.

172
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,039
It's not swim test anxiety.

173
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:19,475
It almost feels like you're missing something-
something important.

174
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,978
Like I don't have a soul?

175
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,549
Aw, honey.
You're not a monster.

176
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,919
<i>My soul's my best friend.!</i>

177
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,324
My soul's like
a toy that never breaks.

178
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:43,027
<i>- I'm master blaster!
- My soul can take your soul.!</i>

179
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,695
Bart sold his soul
And that's just swell

180
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,739
Now he's going straight to

181
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,104
<i>Hello, operator
Give me number nine</i>

182
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,643
<i>No soul, huh?</i>

183
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,077
Don't worry.
I'm still behind ya.

184
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,081
Ha-ha!

185
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,846
Ahoy there, friends!
Everybody find a first mate!

186
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,319
Oh! I choose Martin!

187
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,275
Wait. Wait for me!

188
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,607
Bart, it's time to end this dream

189
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,375
And don't forget the standard scream

190
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,018
An alligator with sunglasses?

191
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,185
Huh!
Now I've seen everything.

192
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,626
Hiya, folks.
Welcome to Uncle Moe's.

193
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,722
Aw, look at all
the cute little minors.

194
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,825
Wow, that's Moe.
The guy from the ad!

195
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,836
Right this way, Homer.

196
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,429
And he knows my name!

197
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,942
Street signs indoors?
Whatever!

198
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:03,276
Now, Rod, you order
anything you want for your big 10-0.

199
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,111
Million-dollar birthday fries!

200
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,117
Uh-oh!

201
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,279
"Moe gets so excited when you order
his million-dollar birthday fries...

202
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,289
he just has to celebrate. "

203
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,188
<i>Here you go! Here I am!</i>

204
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,194
Uncle Moe! Thank you, ma'am!
This'll be a treat!

205
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,696
Uncle Moe!
Here I am, while you eat!

206
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,936
Please take the fries off my head, kid.

207
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,801
The basket is extremely hot.

208
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,569
How are the
southwestern pizza fingers?

209
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,702
Uh, they're, um,
"awesomely outrageous. "

210
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,839
Oh, these look good-
"Guilt-Free Steak-fish Fillets. "

211
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,851
Let me level with you, Marge. That's just
our name for bottom-feeding suction eel.

212
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:45,356
You don't want that.
Why don't you try Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili.

213
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,982
I start with the best part-
the neck.

214
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,527
And then I add secret hobo spices.

215
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,290
<i>Ooh! Très bien.!</i>

216
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,229
Yeah.

217
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,734
What the hell are you doing, you little freak?

218
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,972
Ooh, sorry, kid. Sorry.
I'm not used to the laughter of children.

219
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,976
It cuts through me
like a dentist's drill.

220
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,673
But, no, that was funny,
you taking away my dignity like that. Ha-ha.

221
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,683
I would like to say grace.

222
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,253
<i>Lord, have mercy on my soul...</i>

223
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:20,121
<i>and Mom's soul, and Dad's soul,
and Maggie's soul.</i>

224
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,990
<i>And let every soul in Christendom-</i>

225
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,722
Bart!

226
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,560
I can't take this anymore!
I want my soul, and I want it now!

227
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,863
Bart! You didn't finish
your spaghetti and Moe-balls!

228
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,905
Silence, you fool. It can be ours.

229
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,067
Run, boy! Run!

230
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,235
<i>Run for your life...</i>

231
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,404
<i>boy.!</i>

232
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,244
Milhouse.

233
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,218
Milhouse, you win.
I want this nightmare to end.

234
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:58,260
Leave this place. You are in great danger.

235
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,298
Where's Milhouse?

236
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,562
The one you call Milhouse... is gone.

237
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,031
He went to his grandma's place
while we're sprayin' for potato bugs.

238
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:14,202
Oh. When Milhouse left, did you notice
if he was carrying a piece of paper?

239
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,713
Oh, yeah. You don't
forget a thing like that.

240
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,679
Oh, God.

241
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,048
Here you go! Here I am!
Uncle Moe! Thank you, ma'am!

242
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,854
This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe!
Here I am, while you eat!

243
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,829
- Yea! Now do it for Terri!
- What, it's your birthday too?

244
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,332
We're twins.

245
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,597
Here you go. Here I am.
Eat your fries. Eat 'em.

246
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,262
Here's you!

247
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,773
Aw, geez. And you got
the stink lines and everything?

248
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,909
<i>Oh, dude, you did not smile.
We eat for free.</i>

249
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,507
Come on, Shoshana.
Let's roll. Ha-ha!

250
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,519
But I sang you the potato stuffings!

251
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,953
Come on!
I sang you the potato stuffings!

252
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,117
Look at the vein on that guy's forehead.
He's gonna blow!

253
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,594
<i>Unkie Moe?</i>

254
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,064
What... is it, sweetheart?

255
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,000
My sodie is too cold.
My teef hurt.

256
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,367
Oh, your "teef" hurt, huh?
Your "teef" hurt?

257
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,806
Well, that's too freakin' bad! I'll tell you
where you can put your freakin' "sodie" too!

258
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,242
<i>Oh, my goodness.!</i>

259
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,871
Ow! My freakin' ears!

260
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,882
Oh, let's go, dear.

261
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,511
Well, I expect that type of language
at Denny's, but not here!

262
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,485
Aw, come on, folks, wait.

263
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,454
Please come back. Please!
I got a new offer.

264
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,527
Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you,
you get a free steak-fish.

265
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,995
Okay, okay, Milhouse's grandmother
lives on 257 th Street...

266
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,003
and I'm on 3rd.

267
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,131
Ohh.

268
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,445
Well, finally, a little luck.

269
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,331
<i>I know you and your wife
and every part of you</i>

270
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,695
Son, you wait here while Daddy tries to
talk some sense into this raving derelict.

271
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,873
Ah, what the hell do you want-
You still owe me $50-

272
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,876
Slow down.
Slow down!

273
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,879
Alfred Hitchcock stole every idea I ever had!
He came into my room and-

274
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,881
Who's been stealing your thoughts?

275
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:35,647
<i>Did you ever read The Old Curiosity Shop?
They made that with John Gielgud-</i>

276
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,654
<i>I have powers that-</i>

277
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,088
- Hello, Ralph.
- Aah! Uh, hi, Bart.

278
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,092
I know you from school.

279
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,094
Yes.

280
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,188
A simple proposition, Ralph.
How would you like to make a dollar?

281
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,995
Uh, I don't know.

282
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,503
All you have to do is sign a paper
that says I can have your soul.

283
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,039
I need a soul, Ralph.
Any soul.

284
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,870
Yours!

285
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,207
Hey!
What's going on over there?

286
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,581
Go on, take it all.
Get it all outta here.

287
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,590
You know, Moe, you might wanna
keep the fire extinguishers.

288
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,592
Nah.
Too many bad memories.

289
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,788
Well, look at the bright side, Moe-
you still got us.

290
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:22,355
Yeah. Yeah. You know, that actually
makes me feel a little better.

291
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,369
<i>Why? That was the problem
in the first place.</i>

292
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,372
You were going broke
because we were your only customers.

293
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,171
Wasn't that the problem in the first place,
that you were going broke?

294
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,177
Moe? Moe?

295
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,179
Hey! Moe?

296
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,182
You're thinking about
all the money you blew, aren't ya?

297
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,685
What was it,
50- $60,000? Moe?

298
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,225
Look, maybe it would help if you went over all
the mistakes you made from the beginning. Moe?

299
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,294
- What?
- Let me get a pad.

300
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,034
A caller, at this hour?

301
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:02,164
You dial "9-1,"
then when I say so, dial "1" again.

302
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,004
Milhouse, please.

303
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,739
Bart, I can't play now.
It's 2:00 a. m.

304
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,748
Milhouse, I gotta have my soul back.
I'll do anything you want.

305
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,750
Uh, well-

306
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:17,049
Uh, Milhouse, give him back his soul!
I've got work tomorrow!

307
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,354
I'm really sorry. I kinda traded your soul
to the guy at the comic book store.

308
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,088
But look- I got some cool pogs.

309
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,461
Alf pogs!
Remember Alf?

310
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,693
He's back, in pog form!

311
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,928
You traded my soul for pogs?

312
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,437
No!

313
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,373
<i>Close that door.!
You're letting the heat out.!</i>

314
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,444
<i>Shut up, shut up, shut up.!</i>

315
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,314
If you are waiting for
the Hi and Lois signing...

316
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,182
it has been moved
to the Springfield Coliseum.

317
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,223
Please. You have something
of mine on a piece of paper.

318
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,519
Oh. So you're Bart Simpson.

319
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,528
Since my breakfast burrito
is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt.

320
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,258
You are too late.
I sold your soul last night.

321
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:06,201
<i>Yes, yes. I found a buyer right away
for that item.</i>

322
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,206
- Who?
- I am not at liberty to divulge the party.

323
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,675
But they were most interested
in having possession of a little boy's soul.

324
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,681
Uh, excuse me. No banging your head
on the display case, please.

325
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,684
<i>It contains a very rare Mary Worth...</i>

326
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,347
in which she has advised
a friend to commit suicide, thank you.

327
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,598
Are you there, God?

328
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,601
It's me, Bart Simpson.

329
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,604
I know I never pay
too much attention in church...

330
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:44,142
but I could really use
some of that good stuff now.

331
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,143
I'm... afraid.

332
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:51,148
I'm afraid some weirdo's got my soul,
and I don't know what they're doing to it.

333
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,218
I just want it back.

334
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,521
Please?

335
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,592
I hope you can hear this.

336
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,090
Lisa!
You bought this?

337
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,101
With the change in my piggy bank.

338
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,103
There's no change in your piggy bank.

339
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,106
Not in any of the ones
you know about.

340
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,836
- Oh, Lise, thank you.
- Happy to do it.

341
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,469
But you know, Bart,
some philosophers believe...

342
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,310
that nobody is born with a soul...

343
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,317
that you have to earn one through
suffering and thought and prayer...

344
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,319
like you did last night.

345
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,753
Uh-huh.

346
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,833
<i>Ha.! It's like punting on the Thames.
Stroke. Stroke.</i>

347
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,063
Oh!

348
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,257
Shh!
