<i>- Um, Dad?
- Yeah?</i>

29
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:06,579
What is the mind?
Is it just a system of impulses...

30
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,382
or is it something tangible?

31
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,687
Relax. What is mind?
No matter.

- Sweet dreams.
- Thanks, Mom.

36
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,772
- Sleep tight.
- I will, Mom.

As the weeks went on,
so did the cartoons.

49
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,558

Somebody ate those cookies.

59

Did you eat
the cookies, Maggie?

60
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,983
<i>I think she's trying

61
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,494
- Go on, Maggie.
- Go on, Maggie. Go! Go!

62
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,659
There's no perfect crime.

63
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,737
Ohh!

64
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,569

67

And Maggie can be Medina,
your spunky sidekick.

68
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,715
<i>And you'll be-</i>

69

<i>Bartron, the evil robot
from Mars gone berserk.</i>

70
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,660
Do I understand you correctly, Bartron?

71
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,755
Do you wish me to release you
from the Helmet of Evil Thoughts...

72
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,834
with my enchanted
space wand?

73
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,598
<i>- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- I will do it, Bartron.</i>

74
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,799
But who knows what mysterious forces
will be unleashed?

75
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,309
<i>Oh, no. Inside the evil Bartron...</i>

80
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:35,787
they were no match for Captain Wacky,
later renamed "Homer. "

81
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,729
Wake up, everybody! It's World War III!

82
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,562
<i>Quick.! Down to the fallout shelter.!

Eighteen seconds. Hmm.

If this were really a nuclear war,
we'd all be dead meat by now.

85
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,615

Clean as a whistle, Homer.

- Okay, Mr. Burns.

- Uh, what's your first name?
- I don't know.

122
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,393
Well, Homer, maybe you can
take some consolation...

the real deal with Waylon Smithers...</i>

173
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,159
<i>is that he's Mr. Burns's assistant.</i>

174
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:22,028
He's in his early 40s, is unmarried,
and currently resides in Springfield.

175
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,863
Thanks for writing.
We'll be right back.

176
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:39,111
<i>If you said "Bleeding Gums"
Murphy and Dr. Marvin Monroe...</i>

177
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:42,014
<i>you are wrong-
they were never popular.</i>

178
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,950
Right about now
you're probably saying...

179
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:46,852
<i>"Troy, I've seen
every Simpsons episode.</i>

180
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:49,084
You can't show me
anything new. "

181
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,127
You've got
some attitude, mister.

182
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:55,130
Besides, you're wrong!
Because sometimes episodes run long...

183
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:57,496
and certain scenes
never get aired.

184
00:13:57,601 --> 00:14:00,798
So, fire up your VCR, because here,
for the first time ever...

185
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:03,135
are the cutout classics.

186
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:10,071
<i>When Krusty the Clown got canceled-</i>

187
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,411
<i>he tried everything to stay on the air.</i>

188
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,848
<i>Here's what you didn't see.</i>

189
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:18,683
If you watch my show, I will
send you this book featuring me...

190
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:21,690
in a variety of
sexually explicit positions.

191
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:25,319
What? Oh. Hey! It's not really me.
I used a stunt butt.

192
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,331
Krusty, we're from the network.
We have some bad news.

193
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:33,426
- I'm afraid your show's been canceled.
- I thought this would happen.

194
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,233
I just hope you replace me
with something as educational...

195
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,274
and uplifting
as I tried to be.

196
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,538
Actually, it's a hemorrhoid infomercial
starring Claude Akins.

197
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,806
Can I play
"Hemorrhoid Sufferer Number One"?

198
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:49,079
- Ooh! Oh, that hurts! Aah! Oh, is there no relief?
- I don't think so.

199
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:51,620
Well, how about
one of the "after" guys?

200
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:54,247
Ahh! Oh, that's better.

201
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,690
<i>- I can ride a bike again!
- Sorry.</i>

202
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,694
Ohh.

203
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:01,162
<i>When Springfield
legalized gambling...</i>

204
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:03,358
<i>Homer became
a blackjack dealer...</i>

205
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,459
<i>and comedy was
"in the cards. "</i>

206
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,868
<i>Twenty. Your move, Mr. Bond.</i>

207
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:11,635
I'll take a hit, dealer.

208
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:14,370
Joker. You were supposed to
take those out of the deck.

209
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:18,141
- Oh, sorry. Here's another one.
- What is this card?

210
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:21,946
- "Rules for Draw and Stud Poker?"
- What a pity, Mr. Bond.

211
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,510
<i>But-Well, it was Homer's fault.
I didn't lose. I never lose.</i>

212
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:29,024
Well, at least tell me the details
of your plot for world domination.

213
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:31,651
I'm not going
to fall for that one again.

214
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:34,492
<i>Earlier this year,
Homer's long-lost mother returned...</i>

215
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:38,557
<i>and so did a long-lost care package.</i>

216
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:42,366
<i>Mmm.</i>

217
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:47,376
Homer, please. You don't have to
wolf down that 25-year-old candy...

218
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:52,074
- just to make me happy.
- But it won't make you unhappy, right?

219
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:55,777
Hey! Space food sticks!

220
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:58,446
Oh, I wish I had these
on my space adventure.

221
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:01,581
Did you know I was blasted into space
two years ago, Mom?

222
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,853
Oh, sure. I read all about it.
I mean-

223
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:08,261
<i>It was national news.
Do you... still work for NASA?</i>

224
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:11,766
- No, I work at the nuclear power plant.
- Oh, Homer.

225
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:15,737
Well, you'll be happy to know
I don't work very hard.

226
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,330
Actually, I'm bringing
the plant down from the inside.

227
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,071
<i>When Homer sold his soul
for a doughnut...</i>

228
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:25,842
<i>he found out that hell isn't
all it's cracked up to be...</i>

229
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,147
<i>in these
never-before-broadcast scenes.</i>

230
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,630
Mm, lawyers,
lawyers, lawyers-

231
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,668
Ooh, Lionel Hutz!

232
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,865
"Cases won in 30 minutes
or your pizza's free. " Hmm.

233
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:53,569
I'd sell my soul for
a Formula One racing car.

234
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:56,407
That can be arranged.

235
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:58,845
Changed my mind.
Sorry.

236
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,918
- Cool.
- Bart, stop pestering Satan!

237
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,749
Your Honor, we find
that Homer Simpson's soul...

238
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:07,517
is legally the property of Marge Simpson,
and not of the devil.

239
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:10,923
- Ohh.
- Yea!

240
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:13,087
Whoo-hoo! Ow!

241
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,595
Well, I didn't win.
Here's your pizza.

242
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,430
- But we did win.
- That's okay. The box is empty.

243
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:23,934
If that's what they cut out,
what they leave in...

244
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,941
must be pure gold!

245
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:30,036
<i>Let's watch some more of those
fabulous Simpsons outtakes.</i>

246
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:34,481
<i>Apu living with the Simpsons?
It happened.</i>

247
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,314
<i>And here's a scene
you didn't see.</i>

248
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:39,321
I'm hoping you enjoy this movie.

249
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,755
It made every Indian critic's
Top 400 list.

250
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:58,564
This movie you rented sucks.

251
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,609
No, it doesn't. It's funny.

252
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:04,078
Their clothes are different
from my clothes.

253
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:08,049
Look at what they're wearin'.

254
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:11,553
<i>A few years back,
Bart was adopted by Mr. Burns.</i>

255
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:15,819
<i>In this very special outtake,
Homer attempts a reconciliation...</i>

256
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:18,656
<i>with his estranged son.</i>

257
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:21,492
<i>- Watch.
- Bart, you're coming home.</i>

258
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:23,327
I want to stay here
with Mr. Burns.

259
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:25,334
I suggest you leave immediately.

260
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:28,234
Or what? You'll release
the dogs, or the bees...

261
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:30,306
or the dogs with bees
in their mouth...

262
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,500
and when they bark,
they shoot bees at you?

263
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,407
Well, go ahead.
Do your worst!

264
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,878
My worst, eh?
Smithers...

265
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:41,508
release the robotic Richard Simmons.

266
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:46,354
Come on, big boy!
Shake the butter off those buns!

267
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,596
Come on, girls. Shake, shake, shake.

268
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,601
Smithers, it's out of control.

269
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:02,866
I'll take him out, sir.

270
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:15,714
His ass is gonna blow!

271
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:22,087
This past summer, all of America
was trying to solve the mystery...

272
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:25,093
of"Who Shot Mr. Burns?"

273
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:28,130
Then they found out
it was the baby.

274
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:31,030
To keep this bombshell secret...

275
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:36,004
the producers animated several solutions
that were never intended to air.

276
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:48,279
<i>And to keep the show's
animators, editors...</i>

277
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:51,047
<i>staff and hangers-on from
leaking the solution...</i>

278
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:54,215
<i>two completely different
endings were produced.</i>

279
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:56,622
<i>One real, one phony.</i>

280
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:59,287
<i>Here's the ending
you were never meant to see.</i>

281
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:02,160
The one who shot me was-

282
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:06,865
Waylon Smithers!

283
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,430
No-o!
Wait a minute. Yes.

284
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:17,003
With the sun-blocker in place
and the town aghast, I was on top of the world.

285
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:20,481
<i>So I wanted to kick up my heels
and indulge my sweet tooth.</i>

286
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:23,417
I feel like celebrating.

287
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:29,091
Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?

288
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:32,253
- I see.
- Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt...

289
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:35,695
to take candy from a baby,
but with him out of the picture...

290
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,529
I was free to wallow
in my own crapulence.

291
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:41,365
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

292
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,962
<i>At the last moment, Smithers,
drunk as a lemur...</i>

293
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:46,736
<i>lurched out of the darkness
and fired.!</i>

294
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:49,368
That's right.

295
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:52,312
Right before I shotJasper.

296
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,441
Hmm. I was busy that night.

297
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:57,611
<i>Stricken,
I lurched forth in search of aid.</i>

298
00:20:57,721 --> 00:21:02,351
<i>But finding only slack-jawed gawkers,
I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.</i>

299
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,859
Then, with your last
ounce of strength...

300
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:07,954
you pointed to "W" and "S".

301
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:10,192
Waylon Smithers!

302
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,700
I'm just relieved that Homer's safe
and that you've recovered...

303
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:14,703
and we can all get back to normal.

304
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:16,705
Not exactly.

305
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:19,901
Smithers, for attempting to kill me...

306
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,036
I'm giving you a five percent pay cut.

307
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:25,944
Ohh!

308
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,949
But, of course,
for that ending to work...

309
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:31,020
you would have to ignore
all the Simpson D.N.A. evidence.

310
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:35,353
And that would be downright nutty.

311
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:37,518
Yes, the Simpsons
have come a long way...

312
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:40,062
since an old drunk made humans
out of his rabbit characters...

313
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:42,063
to pay off his gambling debts.

314
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:44,690
Who knows what adventures
they'll have between now...

315
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:48,362
and the time the show
becomes unprofitable?

316
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:52,408
I'm Troy McClure, and I'll leave you
with what we all came here to see:

317
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,477
hard-core nudity!

318
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:43,115
Shh!
