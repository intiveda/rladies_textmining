00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,501
D'oh!

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,633
Ah, spring break in Hong Kong.
Custom-made suits at slave-labor prices.

4
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,464
I- Good Lord!
They've got this all wrong.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,733
Yes, this is Principal Seymour Skinner.

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,537
- How can I help you, Principal?
- I'm afraid there's some problems with my tickets.

7
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,238
I asked for a center seat,
not an aisle seat.

8
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,872
<i>I specifically requested
not to have the kosher meal.</i>

9
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,679
And I booked the flight leaving
Saturday morning, not Friday morning!

10
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,414
Okay, I've gone ahead
and made those changes.

11
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,490
With the one-day
advanced purchase price...

12
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,320
it's just an extra $7,830.

13
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,952
G.M. Chrysler!
I can't afford that!

14
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,625
But I can't close the school
a day early just to suit my vacation.

15
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,899
Or can I? Think, Seymour, think.

16
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,235
"Go To Work With Your Parents Day"?

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,570
Yes, Go To Work With Your Parents Day.

18
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,644
Tomorrow you will learn by doing...

19
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,908
and apply your knowledge of fractions
and gym to real-world situations.

<i>And Scratchy Show</i>

21
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,478
I still don't understand why you get
to stay home and watch Mom work.

22
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,148
Because I've always been an advocate
of women in the workplace, Lise.

23
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,192
I can't help it if Mom's workplace
contains our TV.

24
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:38,731
I'm honored, Bart, and, Lisa, you'll have
a fine time at the plant with Dad.

25
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,266
You've been interested
in nuclear power for years.

26
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,927
I've signed numerous petitions
to shut down that plant.

27
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,335
- Well, there you go!
- Mom, you're blocking the TV.

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,999
If you need something to do,
you can fill out my form. Here.

29
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,339

That's why you don't get paid for it. "

32
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,681
Bart can take my place at the plant.

33
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,449
Oh, but he so wanted
to see women in the workplace.

34
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,525
How about Aunt Patty
and Aunt Selma at the D.M.V.?

35
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,992
Of course! Of course!

36
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,895
<i>I would never ever have thought of that.</i>

37
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,866
Some days we don't let
the line move at all.

38
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,996
We call those "weekdays. "

39
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,540
Good one.

40
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,942
At least I'm not stuck
at the cracker factory like Milhouse.

41
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,946
Wow!

42
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,946
<i>Ever wonder how crackers get salted?</i>

43
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,022
Have I!

44
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,888
- Wow!
- Crackers, ho!

45
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,123
I never knew cracker production
could be so exciting!

46
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,894
But where do they make those crackers
with the peanut butter already inside?

47
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:53,336
- Uh, put this on and come with me, son.
- Whoo-hoo!

48
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,572
Mmm. Doughnut?

49
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,976
No, thanks. Do you have any fruit?

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,345
This has purple stuff inside.
Purple is a fruit.

51
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,350
Uh-

52
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,888
Oh! This is a map of nuclear sites
around the country.

53
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,618
As a safety inspector, I'm responsible
for changing most of these lightbulbs.

54
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,853
Why are there so many burnt-out ones?

55
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,157
'Cause they won't hire an assistant.

56
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,063
Martin, here's $10 to invest in the futures market.

57
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,194
Soy! Soy! Soy!

58
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,536
Soy! Soy! Soy! Soy!

59
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,542
<i>Martin, you're up one million dollars.</i>

60
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,942
<i>Yes!</i>

61
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,710
But now you've lost all but $600.
You got greedy, Martin.

62
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,983
I'm sorry. I guess watching me
isn't any more exciting than being me.

63
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,559
Maybe we can make your job more fun.

64
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,628
- What are those?
- I don't know.

65
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,924
Well, what if we used
our imaginations?

66
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,330
Houston-
We have a problem.

67
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,960
<i>Homer 13 is spinning out of control!</i>

68
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,302
I'm going after him!

69
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,008
Boy, this is a lot more fun
with a second person.

70
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,346
Okay. One more step.

71
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,117
I just gotta go laminate your license.
You'll get it in two to three weeks.

72
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:22,524
Hot damn!
No more sittin' in the dirt at the drive-in.

73
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,496
Bart, I left the driver's-license-making
machine on.

74
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,862
Turn it off.

75
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,606
Twenty-five years old?
You're not 25 years old.

76
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,839
This I.D. is completely fake.

77
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,916
Yes, you're right, Milhouse.

78
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,043
It is a fake,
which makes it a fake I.D.

79
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,951
A fake I.D.? Cool!

80
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,322
And it's our ticket
to the best spring break of our lives!

81
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,191
One adult and two children, please.

82
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,998
I can think of at least
two things wrong with that title.

83
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,237
Twenty-five? Whoa!

84
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,243
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. "S,"
but I gotta check everybody.

85
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,008
What, are you kidding?
I take it as a compliment.

86
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,709
Three beers, please.

87
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,379
Hey! Join the party!

88
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,185
Spring break! Yeah!

89
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,900
Well, when are we gonna get rowdy?

90
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,970
Maybe when we find something
decent to do with this I.D.

91
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,063
We could go rent
a carpet shampooer.

92
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,111
Greetings, chums! Were your days
at work as profitable as mine?

93
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,671
I just had a sinful shopping spree
at Wee World.

94
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:55,186
We're having the best spring break of our lives,
and we don't need you around nerding it up.

95
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,256
That job is taken.

96
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,882
But surely I and my $600...

97
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,460
could play some small part
in your vacation fun.

98
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,462
Oh, yeah, right.

99
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:09,263
Like there's any way to get some kicks with
a big wad of cash and a license to drive-

100
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,237
<i>Wow.!</i>

101
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,976
Ooh, boy, Flipsy!

102
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,275
You and I are going on a road trip.
Whoa!

103
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,253
<i>Ha-ha.</i>

104
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,785
<i>Gentlemen, for our road trip,
I have taken the liberty...</i>

105
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,763
of preparing an airtight
and utterly plausible alibi...

106
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,130
for use on our parents.

107
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,703
I've been selected
to represent the school...

108
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,704
at the National Grammar Rodeo...

109
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,468
at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada.

110
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,009
I've been selected
to represent the school...

111
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,080
at the National Grammar Rodeo
at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada.

112
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,911
<i>I'm going away for a week.
See ya.!</i>

113
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,917
Nah.

114
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,317
The National Grammar Rodeo?

115
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,856
I wish I were going. Oh, wait, wait.

116
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,152
<i>I mean, I wish I was going.</i>

117
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,160
- Is that right, Bart?
- Mm-mmm-mmm.

118
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,890
It's not fair!
I'm the best student in school.

119
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,466
How come I never heard
about this competition?

120
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:18,936
Maybe because you are,
as we say in Latin, a "dorkus malorkus. "

121
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,405
That's not Latin.
Mom, Bart's faking it!

122
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,807
Oh, honey, you've had your glory.
Now it's Bart's turn.

123
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,999
<i>Oh.! Oh.! Now, wait.!</i>

124
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,537
Oh! Yeah. Wait. Oh. Wait! Oh, oh!

125
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,937
<i>Ow! Bart! Nelson hit me!</i>

126
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,942
He sure did.

127
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,846
A cup holder!

128
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:06,112
Bart, we gotta stop and get a cup!
Uh, Bart?

129
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,188
Cruise control, my good man.
Everybody all set back here?

130
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,451
Nelson, good to see ya. Martin, always a pleasure.

131
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,135
<i>Oh.! Diablo Canyon 2...</i>

132
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,798
<i>why can't you be more
like Diablo Canyon 1?</i>

133
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,546
Hello?

134
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,242
Oh! Homie, hello!

135
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,320
I can't remember the last time
you called me from-

136
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,479
Oh. You want to speak to Lisa.

137
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,693
Hi, Lisa.
How's your spring break going?

138
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,625
I'm learning about owls.

139
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,630
Oh, owls, eh?

140
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,565
So you probably wouldn't want to
spend another day at work with me.

141
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:59,331
Sure, I would. I can always learn
about owls this summer at bird camp.

142
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,111
Oh!

143
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,181
We've arrived
in the vast cornfields of Canada!

144
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,773
How much farther
to the grammar rodeo?

145
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,843
Grammar rodeo?
We're going to a grammar rodeo?

146
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,423
We're not going to a grammar rodeo.

147
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,492
- That was just an alibi, Milton.
- Martin.

148
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,493
- Martin.
- Fellows?

149
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,063
<i>- What?
- Where are we going?</i>

150
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,431
Well, I realize it's trite...

151
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,833
but we could tour
the bridges of Madison County.

152
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,305
Hey! Who has better vacation ideas
than Triple-A?

153
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,775
According to the publisher
of this Triple-A guidebook, no one.

154
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,346
I've always wanted
to see Macon, Georgia.

155
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,779
Wait. How about a fair?

156
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,852
Not just a county fair,
not just a Europe fair...

157
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,319
but a world's fair!

158
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,256
- The World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee.
- Keep reading.

159
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,624
The Hungarians have built
a giant, motorized Rubik's Cube...

160
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,197
and the fair's symbol is the sun sphere...

161
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:03,098
which sits atop a 266-foot-tall steel shaft.

162
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,864
- What's inside?
- An information desk!

163
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,667
Cool!

164
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,106
So, it's a choice between
Disney World and Knoxville.

165
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,579
- Knoxville, Knoxville, Knoxville!
- I concur.

166
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,579
You made it!

167
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,555
- Did you have trouble getting past the security guards?
- Security guards?

168
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,024
- Great! You want to get some lunch?
- Sure.

169
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,856
The way I figure it...

170
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,693
if the candy stays in the machine
for more than a year, it's up for grabs.

171
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,529
Why do you need me?

172
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,662
It's a two-man operation,
and you're the only man here I trust.

173
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,672
- Ready?
- Ready.

174
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,242
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

175
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,334
<i>Simpson,
what in God's name are you-</i>

176
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,006
Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers? Razzles,
Skittles, Whatchamacallits, Twizzlers?

177
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,846
They all have hilarious names
and are delicious.

178
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,819
Well, I am partial toJolly Ranchers.

179
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,254
Mmm. Good work, Simpson.

180
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,485
Simpsons.

181
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,529
Boy, Lisa, with you here,
this hardly seems like work at all.

182
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,793
I don't know how I'm gonna make it
through my night shift without you.

183
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,698
- We could have a slumber party.
- Oh, that'd be great!

184
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,102
Sleeping bags on the floor,
a roaring fire.

185
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,232
It'll be just like the time they kicked me
out of the sporting goods store.

186
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,714
If you kids can't keep
your hands to yourself...

187
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,908
I'm gonna turn this car around...

188
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,645
<i>and there'll be no
Cape Canaveral for anybody.!</i>

189
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,489
That's it! Back to Winnipeg!

190
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,422
- Bart, can we stop for ice cream?
- Yes.

191
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,624
Bart, can we weigh the car
at that weigh station?

192
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,633
Yeah.

193
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,329
Bart, can we pick up that hitchhiker?

194
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,338
I don't see why not.

195
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,001
- Bart, could we stop for ice cream?
- Yes.

196
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,045
Well, I didn't think
I was rehabilitated, but, uh...

197
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,341
I guess they needed the extra bed.

198
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,418
With Bart gone, and now you and your father,
I'm not gonna have anyone to-

199
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,685
- Thanks, Mom! Bye!
- talk to.

200
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,763
What is this place?

201
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,927
Branson, Missouri. My dad says it's like Vegas
if it were run by Ned Flanders.

202
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,007
Andy Williams!

203
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,008
We don't need to stop here.

204
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,772
Yes, we do!

205
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,425
Wow!

206
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,295
I didn't think he
was gonna do "Moon River"...

207
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,028
but then, bam- second encore.

208
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,765
Okay. Time for truth or dare.
You go first.

209
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,398
Eh, truth. Ask me anything.

210
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,843
Who do you love most-
me, Bart or Maggie?

211
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,709
D'oh! All right. Dare.

212
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,046
Okay. Why don't you-

213
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,349
Hello. I'd like to speak
with a Mr. Snotball...

214
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,355
first name "Youra. "

215
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,187
- Youra Snotball?
- What? How dare you!

216
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:19,094
If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag
to your butt and mail you to Iran!

217
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,228
- Okay. Your turn.
- Hmm. Truth.

218
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,771
Uh, do you have a crush on anyone?

219
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:30,103
- Dad!
- I- I won't tell anybody.

220
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,373
Dad, you tell everybody everything.
Even Moe knew when I threw up on the dentist.

221
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,847
Moe thinks he knows a lot more
than Moe knows.

222
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,351
Just give me another chance,
and I'll prove I can keep your secret.

223
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,353
Okay.

224
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,414
I like... Langdon Alger.

225
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,824
I have no idea who that is.

226
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,558
Nobody does.
He's very quiet and enjoys puzzles.

227
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,226
But that still doesn't mean
you can tell anyone.

228
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,065
I've already forgotten his name.

229
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,071
It was Larson something, right?

230
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,937
Thanks, Dad.

231
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,308
Oh, this has been
the best spring break ever!

232
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,381
And with my patented seminar...

233
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,450
you will learn how to corner
the real estate market through hypnosis.

234
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,748
Why waste your hypnotic powers
on neighbors and coworkers?

235
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,824
I can't take this anymore.

236
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,307
Oh. Oh, there. Oh, Maggie. There.

237
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,319
We're on the homestretch.

238
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:53,414
Next stop, the Knoxville World's Fair
and its fabulous sun sphere!

239
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,656
Hurry up. We've only got
four days to spend at the-

240
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,259
<i>"Wod Fir"?</i>

241
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,909
Uh, excuse me.
Is this the world's fair visitor's center?

242
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,244
Used to be, back in 1982.

243
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,182
You're 14 years too late.

244
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:25,246
But there's another world's fair
coming soon, right?

245
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,416
Before Friday?

246
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,427
- What about the sun sphere?
- You mean the wig sphere.

247
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,497
You're welcome to go up there...

248
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,398
if you want to see
16,000 boxes of unsold wigs.

249
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,835
Now, are you gentlemen gonna
buy some wigs or ain't ya?

250
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,737
I guess fate was against us.

251
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,935
It's really nobody's fault, right?

252
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,979
Huh? Right?

253
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,947
We've still got a car and a wad of cash.

254
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,416
Uh, no, we don't.

255
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,011
I must have spent our last $10
on this Al Gore doll.

256
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,818
You are hearing me talk.

257
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,621
I hate this place.

258
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,393
- We've got no car.
- We've got no money.

259
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,469
And no one knows we're here!

260
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,539
We're stranded!

261
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,939
But on the plus side,
I knocked over the sun sphere.

262
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,546
Ha-ha!

263
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,846
This never would've happened
if we'd gone to Macon, Georgia.

264
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,981
I'm just sayin', is all.

265
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,721
Fellows, I think perhaps the time
has come to call our parents.

266
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,729
No! They'd kill us.

267
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,527
Look, we got here on our own,
so we can survive here on our own.

268
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,693
All we need is money, food
and a way to get home. Follow me.

269
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,034
Everybody remember-
we're parked under the sun sphere.

270
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,172
Hey! I need those to see!

271
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,376
These lenses are perfect. Now I can
rebottom those antique Coke bottles.

272
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,385
Three hundred-

273
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,821
- Hey! Come back.
- Four hundred, 500, 600-

274
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,391
- Ow.
- Five hundred, 400, 300, 200, 100, zero.

275
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,260
Come on! This train goes
right through Springfield.

276
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:31,442
<i>Well, of course I'll accept.</i>

277
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,713
Bart! I've missed you so mu-

278
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,913
You want to speak to Lisa?

279
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,388
So how's
the National Grammar Rodeo, Bart?

280
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,587
Lisa, I need your help, so I'm gonna let you in
on a secret- there's no such thing.

281
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,688
I knew it! I knew it! Because why would they have
our national grammar rodeo in another nation?

282
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,768
You're gonna be in so much trouble-

283
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,893
I'm in trouble already.
Here's what happened.

284
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,143
So you've got to think of a way
I can come home for free.

285
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:04,238
Hmm. You could travel for free
if you were a stewardess.

286
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,977
Well, how badly
do you want to get home?

287
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,886
All right, all right. How about a courier?
They travel for free too.

288
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,287
No, that's a terrier. They're dogs.

289
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,396
Well, you sure don't look 25...

290
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,591
but your unlaminated, out-of-state
driver's license is proof enough for me.

291
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,066
Here's your first assignment.

292
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,939
What the-

293
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,611
Can we call our parents yet, Bart?

294
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,713
<i>Lisa.</i>

295
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,021
This isn't working. I've got to courier
something to Springfield...

296
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,995
and it's gotta be big enough to fit
Milhouse, Martin and Nelson inside.

297
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,395
But, Bart, that'll cost a fortune.

298
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,096
Simpson, how would you like to escort
500 Big Macs to Marlon Brando's island?

299
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,537
I can't take much more of this.
I'm counting on you, Lise.

300
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,615
- Whee.
- What's wrong, honey?

301
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,551
There's something troubling me, but I don't
think I can tell you because it's a secret.

302
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,886
You don't have to tell me, but I thought
we trusted each other with our secrets now.

303
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,120
I mean, I haven't told a soul
about your new boyfriend.

304
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,095
Langdon Alger?
Oh, I don't like him anymore.

305
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:30,100
Okay, but you gotta promise you won't
get mad or tell anyone, especially Bart.

306
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,932
- I promise.
- Bart rented a car with a phony driver's license...

307
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,563
and drove Milhouse, Nelson and Martin
to a wig outlet in Knoxville...

308
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,472
and the car got crushed, and they're out
of money and they can't get home...

309
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,102
and Bart's working as a courier
and just came back from Hong Kong.

310
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,410
Yes. That's a real pickle.

311
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,314
Would you excuse me for a moment?

312
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,524
All right.
I have thought this through.

313
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:05,092
I will send Bart the money to fly home,
then I will murder him.

314
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,832
No! No! Then he'll know I told!

315
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,135
Dad, you said I could trust you.

316
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,870
Okay.

317
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,778
We'll work this out together.
First things first-Where is Knoxville?

318
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,318
It's in Tennessee, right next
to the Oak Ridge nuclear facility...

319
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,444
birthplace of the atomic bomb.

320
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,250
Well, maybe we could order something
from Oak Ridge.

321
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,325
And Bart could be the courier.

322
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,719
Y'ello. Oak Ridge?
This is Springfield Nuclear.

323
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,823
We need to order a, uh-

324
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,463
"T-437 safety command console. "

325
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,838
Uh, Springfield, my computer shows
your T-437 is fully operational.

326
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,343
Uh, I suggest you-

327
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,505
Oh, my God! Oh, God, no!

328
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,515
Oh, this can't be happening!

329
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,415
You're operating
without a T-437, Springfield!

330
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,011
Oh, sweet mother of mercy!
I mean- I mean, my God!

331
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:02,719
And have it sent to the Springfield
Nuclear Power Plant, care of HomerJ. -

332
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,422
No! Don't use your real name,
or Bart will know!

333
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,498
Forget the name Homer Simpson.

334
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,194
Have it sent care of Langdon Alger.

335
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,635
<i>Bart? Bart?</i>

336
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,199
Hey! We really could use
another air hole!

337
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,712
Shh! They'll know you're in there.

338
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,942
But I don't think
I'd go back again next year.

339
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:31,250
It's gettin' too commercial. They've forgotten
it's supposed to be about the grammar.

340
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,397
Hello?

341
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,128
Oh, hello, Principal Skinner.

342
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,467
No. Bart has never been to Hong Kong.

343
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,273
Good night.

344
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,605
Good night.

345
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,839
Hello? Tennessee State Police?

346
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,676
No, my son's car
was not crushed in Knoxville.

347
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,411
I don't know where to begin
telling you what's wrong with that.

348
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,487
<i>Hello?</i>

349
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:09,288
<i>No, Bart is not available tomorrow
to deliver a human kidney to Amsterdam.</i>

350
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,331
<i>Homer. Are you laughing at me?</i>

351
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,527
Shh!
