1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,669
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,471
D'oh!

3
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,930
Grampa! I don't mind when you spit at home.

4
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,972
But I have to work with these people.

5
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,975
Oh, jabber jacks! Schoolhouse don't
put out spittoons, I ain't responsible.

6
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,875
<i>All right, seniors...</i>

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,541
we'd all love to share in your wisdom,
experience, yadda, yadda, yadda.

8
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,982
Let's start with
Milhouse's grandfather.

9
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,816
Uh, how many of you have a house?

10
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:59,619
All right. Now how many of you
drove your house to school today?

11
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,921
- Huh?
- What?

12
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,326
Well, I did.

13
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,424
No, I'm not Superman.
I just own an R.V.

14
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,699
<i>Me and the new wife travel
the country searching for adventure.</i>

15
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:17,709
- Last fall, we won a chili
cook-off in Beaumont, Texas. - Wow!

16
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,905
<i>You're livin'in a fool's
paradise, Van Houten.</i>

17
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,074
If you fell down in the shower,
that thing'd be your tomb.

18
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,950
Grampa, hush! Here.
Why don't you spit some more?

19
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:32,184
No, I'm not Superman.
I'm a judge.

20
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,819
Why, just this morning
I sentenced my 46th man to death.

21
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,988
No, 47 th.

22
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,830
Wow, 47!
I love you, Grandpa.

23
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,065
<i>Yeah, well, I may not have
a fancy black bathrobe...</i>

24
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,073
and a hammer like Snooty...

25
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,167
but I do have slippers
and an oatmeal spoon.

26
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,441
- Look!
- Bart, perhaps your grandfather...

27
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,847
would like to come up front now and
give someone else a chance to interrupt.

28
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,852
Oh, please, no.

29
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,650
About time, knothead.

30
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:08,455
<i>Now- Hey, listen!</i>

31
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,689
<i>Now, my story begins
in nineteen dickety-two.</i>

32
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,996
We had to say "dickety," 'cause
the kaiser had stolen our word "twenty. "

33
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,696
I chased that rascal to get it back...

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,740
<i>but gave up after dickety-six miles.</i>

35
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,776
Dickety? Highly dubious.

36
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,846
What are you cackling at,
fatty? Too much pie.

37
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,073
That's your problem.

38
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,481
Now, I'd like to digress
from my prepared remarks...

39
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,748
to discuss how I invented
the "terlet. "

40
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,291
Terlet. Ha!

41
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,293
Stop your snickering!
I spent three years on that terlet!

42
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:54,400
And then he claimed he was the one who
turned cats and dogs against each other.

43
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,442
Why is he always making up
those crazy stories?

44
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,843
- Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.
- You already put him in a home.

45
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,541
Maybe it's time we put him
in one where he can't get out.

46
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,550
No! Old people
deserve our respect.

47
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,882
Look atJacques Cousteau
and Goldie Hawn.

48
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,217
You wouldn't shut them away
like second-class citizens.

49
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,223
Second-class!

50
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,226
What about Social Security,
bus discounts...

51
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,058
medic alert jewelry,
Gold Bond powder...

52
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,223
pants all the way
up to your armpits...

53
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,233
and all those other senior perks.

54
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,270
Oh, if you ask me,
old folks have it pretty sweet.

55
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,437
Mm, let's see.

56
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,773
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,183
Eh, this junk was hardly
worth gettin' up for.

58
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:46,190
Maybe if I go back to sleep for a few days,
some good mail will build up.

59
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,420
Hey, what's this?
"Asa Phelps has"-

60
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,930
The seventh Hellfish is dead!

61
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,900
That means the fortune's almost mine.

62
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:09,003
Asa Phelps spent
his entire life in Springfield...

63
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:14,451
<i>except for a four-year service in World War II
and one high school day trip.</i>

64
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,888
<i>He worked at the United Strut
and Bracing Works as a molders boy...</i>

65
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:23,986
<i>until he was replaced
by a Moldermatic and died.</i>

66
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,313
Would you do the honors?

67
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,587
Well, Simpson, seven gone.

68
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,249
As soon as you're
in your pressboard coffin...

69
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,826
I'll be the sole survivor,
and the treasure will be mine.

70
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,827
Over my dead body it will!

71
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,920
That's exactly the point!

72
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:03,435
Oh, Simpson, can't you go five seconds
without humiliating yourself?

73
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,402
How long was that?

74
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,773
Your clownish behavior
notwithstanding...

75
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,869
we have made
a gentleman's agreement...

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,676
and sworn on our lives to honor it.

77
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,616
Smithers, I want that man killed.

78
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,557
Well, let's see.
Mesmerists, dowsers, Luddites, alienists...

79
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,687
Zoroastrians, alphabetizers-

80
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,266
Aha! Assassins!

81
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,097
I was wondering, sir.
Do we really need to, uh...

82
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,103
settle Abe Simpson?

83
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,230
I mean, I'm familiar
with his physical state...

84
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,935
and perhaps if we wait,
nature will assassinate him for us.

85
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:48,036
Well, I can't risk it. I won't allow that
Simpson boy to take the Hellfish bonanza.

86
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,240
And I can't get it without his key.

87
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,910
Ah, just the man I need.

88
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,251
Fernando Vidal, the world's
most devious assassin.

89
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,125
<i>- Hola.
- Fernando, it's M.B.</i>

90
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,927
Ah, Marion Barry. Is it time
for another shipment already?

91
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,834
<i>- Oi! This is Montgomery Burns!
- Oh, caramba.</i>

92
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,702
I'm sending you a photo
over the Faxtrola.

93
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,504
I need you to fly to Springfield
and assassinate this man posthaste.

94
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,108
Ah, Del Monte.

95
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,456
Enjoy them, old man.
They will be your last.

96
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,798
Hey, what the- I'm up! I'm up!

97
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,337
Ah, he's more clever
than he looks.

98
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,706
Abraham Simpson,
your family is here to visit you.

99
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,787
Hot diggety!
My family's come to visit me!

100
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,755
It-Wait a minute!

101
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:08,349
My family never comes to vi-

102
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,654
D'oh! Not again!

103
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,825
I can't take much more of your
blundering numskullery.

104
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,835
I'll be in the car, dudes.

105
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,776
There is one more way
to kill a man...

106
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,744
but it is as intricate
and precise...

107
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,941
as a well-played game of chess.

108
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,746
Was that me,
or was that you?

109
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,562
Help! Nurse! Someone's
trying to kill me!

110
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,227
Okay, we'll do something
about that right away.

111
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,998
Let's start by doubling
your medication.

112
00:07:56,442 --> 00:08:01,402
Our residents...
are trying... to nap!

113
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,942
<i>Ah.! Let me in.!</i>

114
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,418
<i>Someone's trying to kill me.!
Sweet merciful McGillicutty.!</i>

115
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,115
<i>You gotta open the door.!</i>

116
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,522
- Who is it?
- It's Grampa.

117
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,255
And it sounds like he's gotten
into the horseradish again.

118
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,457
And then a knife
flew at my head!

119
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,898
And you were there...

120
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,902
and you were there.

121
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,336
Uh, Grampa, maybe I should
moisten your washcloth.

122
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,340
It's plenty moist! Listen!

123
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,343
Monty Burns is trying to
kill me, and it's all because-

124
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,107
Uh, um,
I can't tell you why.

125
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,205
Well, I'm sure
you'll make up something.

126
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,614
Maybe you just need
more of my classmates around.

127
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,314
I gotta hole up here for a while.
They might still be after me!

128
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,224
Wow! He's even more
agitated than usual.

129
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,124
- Maybe we should let him stay.
- Where are we going to put him?

130
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,287
- Bart's room.
- Bart's room.

131
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,864
- Bart's room.
- Dumpster.

132
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,970
Sorry to crowd you, boy,
but I'll let you in on a secret.

133
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,374
Burns is after me 'cause
he wants the Hellfish bonanza.

134
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,504
Look, if you're
gonna stay in my room...

135
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,707
could you at least stop
making up gibberish?

136
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,614
Gibberish, eh?
Then what's this?

137
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,620
<i>Wrinkly gibberish?</i>

138
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:21,716
I got this
in the Second World War II.

139
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,228
Back then I was known
as Sergeant Simpson...

140
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,198
<i>and I commanded
the Flying Hellfish...</i>

141
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,397
<i>the fightingest squad
in the fightingest company...</i>

142
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,406
<i>in the third-fightingest
battalion in the army.</i>

143
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,601
<i>We were all from Springfield.</i>

144
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,736
<i>There was Police Chief
Wiggum's father, Iggy Wiggum.</i>

145
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:45,783
Um, if anybody finds a grenade
without a pin, that's mine.

146
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,285
<i>Our radioman, Sheldon Skinner.</i>

147
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,481
All right, very funny.

148
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,049
Well, I didn't join
the service to make friends.

149
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,892
<i>And watching our backs
was Private Fifth Class Arnie Gumble.</i>

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,230
<i>Then there was also
Griff, Asa, Ox and Etch.</i>

151
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,566
<i>But every unit
has a troublemaker.</i>

152
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,199
<i>Ours was a cocky little private
named Montgomery Burns.</i>

153
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,403
Haven't you won the war yet?

154
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,709
Duh, hey!
You said you was dead.

155
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:21,651
Yes. Dead tired. But I'm quite
refreshed now. Thank you.

156
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,588
Mm-hmm. You bossed around
the richest, most powerful guy in town?

157
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,592
How come you were a sergeant
and he was only a private?

158
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:33,131
Well, he got busted down for obstructing
a probe from J. Edgar Hoover.

159
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,132
We got stuck with him.

160
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,466
<i>Now they'll never
save your brain, Hitler.</i>

161
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,009
<i>Little help?</i>

162
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:56,151
Boom! Boom it went!
Boom! Just like that!

163
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,691
<i>They took a photo of my keister
for Stars and Stripes.!</i>

164
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,727
<i>At least they told me
it was for Stars and Stripes.</i>

165
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,729
Well, if you saved Burns's life,
why does he want to kill you?

166
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,890
It was the closing days
of the war.

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,492
We had just flushed some Germans
out of an abandoned castle.

168
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,738
Hey! Burnsie
found some pictures.

169
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,508
Wait a minute. We ain't-a supposed
to steal from civilians.

170
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,915
You want me to report you to Commander
Flanders? Just leave them, Burnsie.

171
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,919
Leave them for whom?
The Germans?

172
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,751
The folks who shoot at us all day?
Let's just take them.

173
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,916
We'll all be rich- rich as Nazis.

174
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,620
Wow! I'd like to be as rich as the Nazis!

175
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,425
Think of what a guy could get himself
with that kind of scratch.

176
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,330
Yeah. I could buy chicken
dinners three times a day.

177
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,632
I could buy a brand-new Studebaker
with a fan on the dashboard.

178
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,469
I could buy my way into high-
society.

179
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,668
Well, I don't feel
right about it...

180
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,143
but I could use a nest egg
for retirement.

181
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,942
I'd hate to wind up
in one of them old folks' homes.

182
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,949
<i>Then it's agreed.</i>

183
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,077
Of course, we can't sell
the paintings now. We'd be caught.

184
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,248
How many of you are familiar
with the concept of a tontine?

185
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,719
All right, Ox. Why don't you
take us through it.

186
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,890
Uhh, essentially, we all
enter into a contract...

187
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,559
whereby the last
surviving participant...

188
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,036
becomes the sole possessor
of all them "perty" pictures.

189
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,042
Well put, Oxford. Now remember,
you can't all sign with an "X."

190
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,076
<i>So we sealed up the paintings...</i>

191
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:33,242
<i>knowing only one of us
would ever look upon them again.</i>

192
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,188
Ox was the first to go.

193
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,259
He got a hernia carrying
the crate out of the castle.

194
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,592
Five more men died in the Veterans Day
float disaster of'79.

195
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:49,600
Now, with Asa gone,
it's down to me and Burns.

196
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,194
Great story, Grampa.
Could've used a vampire though. Night.

197
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:57,366
My own grandson thinks I'm a liar.

198
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,008
Don't kill me!

199
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,448
I've tried to meet you
halfway on this, Simpson...

200
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,214
but you had to be
littleJohnny Live-A-Lot.

201
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,313
Now give me your key
to the Hellfish bonanza.

202
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,858
Oh, wow!
There really is a treasure!

203
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,656
- Whatever you do, don't give him the key, Grampa.
- Here's the key.

204
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,630
Aw, figures.
Hey, Mr. Burns!

205
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,633
Can I go with you
to get the treasure?

206
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,397
I won't eat much, and I don't know
the difference between right and wrong.

207
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,404
Oh, you're a good boy...

208
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,202
but the child labor people have
been watching me like a hawk.

209
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,710
Well, I'm off to get the paintings.
As they say, "time is Monets. "

210
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,441
As you were, Sergeant.

211
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,813
<i>Oh, terribly sorry.
Back to sleep, little girl.</i>

212
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,820
<i>Santa?</i>

213
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,925
I guess Burns
is finally gonna be rich.

214
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,260
Not without the keys he isn't.

215
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,300
Hey, you got the keys!

216
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,530
- Now we can get the treasure!
- Oh, what's the use?

217
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,472
Burns would still find
some way to take it from me.

218
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,510
I can't believe you, Grampa.

219
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,479
The sergeant in that story you told would
never be scared of a dork like Burns.

220
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,643
You gotta get that treasure. You gotta do it
for Ox and Asa and Griff and Burnsie!

221
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,879
Well, not so much Burnsie.

222
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,014
You really think I can do it?

223
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,753
Uh, yes. But we gotta act fast.

224
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,126
Where are you two going
at this hour?

225
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,290
- On a treasure hunt.
- Oh, can I come?

226
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,266
Only if you're ready
to stare danger in the face...

227
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,133
put your manhood
to the ultimate test and take-

228
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,366
Pass.

229
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,944
Hey, Grampa, do you think your dead buddies
get up and walk around at night?

230
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,413
If they're anything like me,
they have to get up twice.

231
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,418
Okay, hold up here.
Fellas, it's me, Sarge.

232
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,648
At ease. I know I'm bending
the rules tonight...

233
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:55,818
but I also know none of you wants
that skunk Burns to take our treasure.

234
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,694
And I want you to know
that when I die...

235
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:04,861
you're all welcome to visit me
in Rich Man's Heaven.

236
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,984
Now it's gonna show us
exactly where to dig.

237
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,304
<i>D'oh.!</i>

238
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,068
Boy, you borrow us some diving
equipment while I borrow this boat.

239
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,413
Well, howdy-doodilly, stranger. Couldn't
help but notice you stealing my boat.

240
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,074
- I'll bring it back.
- You ever operated a power boat?

241
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,016
- No.
- Know anything about water safety?

242
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,053
- No.
- What do you need it for?

243
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,022
<i>- It's a secret.
- Ooh, sounds spine-tingly-dingling.</i>

244
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,718
Just promise
you'll have a good time.

245
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,490
Maude! Boys! Come on up! We're gonna
have a little campout in the dinghy.

246
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,497
<i>Yea.!</i>

247
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,595
Now remember the plan, boy.

248
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,868
If you run out of air,
tug on the rope-

249
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,274
<i>Sixty-four times.
No more, no less. Got it.</i>

250
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,006
No, no! Sixty-three times
if you're out of air!

251
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,309
Sixty-four is if you've
found the treasure.

252
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,785
Gotcha. Hey, Grampa, do you think
I could've been a Flying Hellfish?

253
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:33,790
You're a gutsy daredevil with a give-'em-hell
attitude and a fourth-grade education.

254
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,486
You could've made sergeant.

255
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,077
Wow!

256
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:13,362
Sixty-one, 62, 63-

257
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,799
Oh, no! Sixty-three!
He's out of air!

258
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,134
I've sent my only grandson
to a watery grave!

259
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,075
Sixty-four!
He found the treasure! I'm rich!

260
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,312
You're one heck
of a grandson, boy.

261
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,412
Now let's break her open
and have a look-see.

262
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,964
Oh! Hey- Huh?

263
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,298
Huh. The light
must've burned out.

264
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,168
I'll thank you to stop pinching my Botticelli.

265
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,301
Looks like I didn't need
the keys after all.

266
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,470
I'll take the masterpieces.
Thank you.

267
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,741
Consarn it!

268
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,980
You coward! You're an embarrassment
to the name Hellfish!

269
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,990
Oh, am I?

270
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,119
No! Look! Take the art if you want.
Just don't hurt the boy.

271
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,527
Hmm. I'd rather do both.

272
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,235
<i>So long, Sarge. See you
at the reunion in November.</i>

273
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,570
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

274
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,949
I'm sorry I cost you
your fortune, Grampa.

275
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,748
Ah, the fortune doesn't matter, boy.

276
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,483
The important thing is you're safe.

277
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,525
Now let's get that fortune!

278
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,362
They're gaining on us, sir.
We'll have to jettison something.

279
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,995
It's been an honor to serve you, sir.

280
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,401
Consarn it!
He's getting away!

281
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,406
In a pig's eye he is!

282
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,053
Act your age, Simpson!
You look foolish!

283
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,662
- Don't kill me.
- I ain't gonna kill ya.

284
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,742
That'd be cowardly.
Monty Burns cowardly.

285
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,642
I just wanna watch you squirm.

286
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,112
Yes, sir.
Is this to your liking?

287
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,185
Now, Burnsie, there's one thing
we don't stand for in the Hellfish...

288
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,725
and that's trying to kill
your commanding officer.

289
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,228
So consider this
your dishonorable discharge.

290
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,129
<i>You're out of my unit.
You're out of the tontine.</i>

291
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,725
And that means
the paintings are mine!

292
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,237
Private, you are dismissed!

293
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,175
You're rich, Grampa!
You did it!

294
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,940
And Burns can never
take that away from you.

295
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,250
Freeze! U.S. State Department.
We'll take those.

296
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,687
We've been helping the German government
search for this stolen art for 50 years.

297
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,418
To avoid an international incident,
we'll be returning it...

298
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,893
to the descendant
of its rightful owner.

299
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:09,400
Baron Von Bertzenberger, on behalf
of the American people, I apologize for-

300
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,470
<i>Ja, ja, ja. Mach schnell
mit the art things, huh?</i>

301
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:17,804
I must get back to Dance Central
in Stuttgart in time to see Kraftwerk.

302
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,811
<i>Hey, und, dummkopf! Watch out
for the CD changer in my trunk, huh?</i>

303
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,813
Idiot.

304
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,256
I guess he deserves it
more than I do.

305
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:36,726
Well, at least I got to show you
I wasn't always a pathetic old kook.

306
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,863
You never were, Grampa.

307
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:45,164
Oh, I'd hug ya, but I know
you'd just get embarrassed.

308
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,501
I won't get embarrassed.
I don't care who knows I love my grampa.

309
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,603
Hey, fun boys! Get a room!

310
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,694
Shh!
