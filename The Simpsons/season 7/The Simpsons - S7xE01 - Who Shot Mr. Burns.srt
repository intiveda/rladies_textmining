1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,202
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,508
D'oh!

3
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,205
Ick, my mouth
tastes like an ashtray.

4
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,846
Smithers, wait your turn.
There's plenty of hot water for all.

5
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,751
Sir, you weren't shot.

6
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,484
It was all a dream.

7
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,618
That's right.
The year is 1965.

8
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,254
And you and I are undercover detectives
on the hot-rod circuit.

9
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,390
Now let's burn rubber, baby!

10
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,269
<i>Speedway Squad! In color.</i>

11
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,811
<i>Wait.
That was all a dream.</i>

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:23,042
Aw! Hey, then maybe
I haven't become a hideous, drunken wreck.

13
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,607
And- Oh

14
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,517
Dozens of people are gunned down
each day in Springfield...

15
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,522
but until now
none of them was important.

16
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:36,084
I'm Kent Brockman. At 3:00 p. m. Friday,
local autocrat C. Montgomery Burns...

17
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,994
was shot, following
a tense confrontation at town hall.

18
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,091
Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital,
where he was pronounced dead.

19
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:46,536
He was then transferred to a better hospital,
where doctors upgraded his condition to alive.

20
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,699
Now let's talk
to Police Chief Wiggum.

21
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,709
Oh. Oh, hiya, Ken.

22
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,439
Uh, right now we are
questioning two witnesses...

23
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,107
who were in the vicinity
at the time.

24
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,744
Did you see this guy? Was he anywhere
near the parking lot when Burns got shot?

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,190
Oh, it's no use.
They ain't talkin'.

26
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,726
Everyone in Springfield
had a reason to shoot Mr. Burns.

27
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,921
Even us.

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,089
<i>Bart, he broke your dog's legs.</i>

29
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,099
<i>Grampa, he destroyed your home.</i>

30
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,897
<i>And, Dad, well, you kinda went berserk
when he couldn't remember your name.</i>

31
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,370
Berserk is right!

32
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,373
May I have some iced tea, please?

33
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,171
Aren't we forgetting someone,
sister suspect?

34
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,076
Yeah, I was just getting to me.

35
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,615
Because of Mr. Burns,
they canceled my jazz program...

36
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,912
and my friend Tito Puente
got fired.

37
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,249
- But I could never shoot someone.
- Could so.

38
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,380
- Could not. Could not.
- Could so. Could so.

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,223
<i>Kids, kids, kids. As far as Daddy's concerned,
you're both potential murderers.</i>

40
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,956
The police already have a suspect.
It's Mr. Smithers.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,094
Oh, I bet he's the one.
Yeah, Smingers did it.

42
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:54,196
Case closed. Now, where's my hat?
I'm going to the outhouse.

43
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,708
- We don't have an outhouse.
- My toolshed! Oh, Dad!

44
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,110
Oh! Could I have shot
Mr. Burns in a drunken rage?

45
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,649
No, no, not me. I know in my heart I-

46
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,651
A gun.

47
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,983
And it's been
recently fired. Wait.

48
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,886
I remember leaving
the town meeting.

49
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,059
<i>I must have run into Mr. Burns outside and-</i>

50
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,563
Hey!

51
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,625
Mr. Burns. What have I done?

52
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:38,707
Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna
go tear down Burns's sun-blockin' machine.

53
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,752
- You wanna come with?
- Sure.

54
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,651
I've had it up to here
with these damn rickets.

55
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,759
Pull, Duchess, pull!

56
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,236
Um, uh, what town
did we just crush?

57
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,974
Shelbyville.

58
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,711
Oh, this guilt is driving me mad.

59
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,049
I've got to tell someone.

60
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,586
Father, I'm not a Catholic, but-

61
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,457
Well, I tried to march
in the St. Patrick's Day parade.

62
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:28,398
Anyway, I've got
a rather large sin to confess.

63
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,797
I'm the one who-
who shot Mr. Burns.

64
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,434
- That's all I needed to hear.
Boy, this thing works great.

65
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,241
The man became consumed by greed.
He'd steal from anyone.

66
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,044
This isn't a rival company you're battling with.
It's a school.

67
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,551
- People won't stand for it.
- Pish-posh.

68
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,214
It will be like taking
candy from a baby.

69
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,018
<i>Say, that sounds like a "larf. "</i>

70
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,791
And when he tried
to steal our sunlight...

71
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:01,162
he crossed that line between everyday villainy
and cartoonish super-villainy.

72
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,134
Bah! He was a rank amateur...

73
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,798
compared to Dr. Colossus.

74
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,302
Ow! Oh!
When is my lawyer coming?

75
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,984
<i>Uh, Dave Shutton,
Springfield Daily Shopper.</i>

76
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,986
Who are you?
Where you going?

77
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,818
Oh, do your research, Shutton.
Uh, Kent Brockman, Channel Six News.

78
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,792
How does it feel to be accused of the
attempted murder of your boss and mentor?

79
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,659
Kent, I- I feel
about as low as Madonna...

80
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,823
when she found out she missed Tailhook.

81
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,992
I'm gonna say ouch
for Madonna.

82
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,799
Hey, that's my Madonna gag.
That guy stole my gag.

83
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,171
<i>And you stole it from last Friday's episode
of Pardon My Zinger.</i>

84
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,575
Stole, made up-what's the difference?

85
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,512
Mr. Smithers must have
seen that program too.

86
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,175
He never misses it. Hmm.

87
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,083
At the town meeting, he mentioned that
he watched Comedy Central.

88
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,591
I made sure to note that,
as it seemed quite unusual.

89
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,422
Ye gods!
To the police station, Krusty!

90
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:07,659
I am Melvin Van Horn,
and this is my associate, Hershel Krustofski.

91
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,498
- Hey, hey.
- Officers, you have arrested an innocent man.

92
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,199
Really? Oh, geez.
All right, Colossus, you're free to go.

93
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,039
- But stay away from Death Mountain.
- But all my stuff is there.

94
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,740
I was referring to Waylon Smithers.

95
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,477
Mr. Burns was shot
Friday at 3:00 p. m...

96
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,748
<i>the very time that Smithers
was at home watching Pardon My Zinger.</i>

97
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,551
So, you see,
he couldn't have done it.

98
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,558
Yes, you're right. I remember now.

99
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,560
I- I watched that entire show.

100
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,689
In fact, I left the town meeting early
so I could get home in time.

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,635
Oh, I gotta run,
or I'll miss the opening rank-out.

102
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,366
<i>You better get out
of my way, please.</i>

103
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,205
Slow down. The sidewalk's
for regular walkin', not for fancy walkin'.

104
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,677
<i>Get outta my way.
I'm in a hurry.</i>

105
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,341
You simmer down, I'll let you go.

106
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,249
So, instead of wounding
an evil old man...

107
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,482
I may have killed
an innocent old man.

108
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,490
That's much worse.

109
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,584
About 50,000 volts worse,
if you know what I mean.

110
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,186
Sizzle!

111
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:17,497
Wait a minute. If a second old geezer got shot,
how come nobody reported it?

112
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:25,071
Uh, hi.
Um, could we take a look at your leg?

113
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,880
Yeah, it's real spruce.
You like it?

114
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,917
Thank God.

115
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,046
Sir, I- I only hope you can forgive me
for shooting your wooden leg.

116
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,056
You shot who in the what now?

117
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,787
Okay, Smithers, you're free to go.
And, you, one question.

118
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,863
Do you know who shot Mr. Burns?

119
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,694
'Cause we are really up the creek on this one.

120
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,964
And with the prime suspect cleared
and found completely innocent...

121
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:58,271
we must now ask ourselves:
Who could be as bloodthirsty as Waylon Smithers?

122
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,743
I guess it's never
the most likely suspect.

123
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,611
Actually, Mom,
in 95% of cases, it is.

124
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:07,152
The rest of the time it's usually
some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.

125
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,279
Hey, I had a damn good reason.

126
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,619
He could never
remember my name.

127
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,989
Who the devil are you?

128
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,457
It's Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!

129
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,798
Well, I don't think anyone in this family
is capable of attempted murder.

130
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:29,068
Uh-uh-uh.
You never know what you're capable of.

131
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,076
I never thought
I could shoot down a German plane...

132
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,011
but last year
I proved myself wrong.

133
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,139
Nancy Drew says that all you need
to solve a mystery...

134
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,582
is an inquisitive temperament
and two good friends.

135
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,984
And I've got an inquisitive temperament.
Maybe I could help solve this.

136
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,421
I think you're a little young...

137
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,925
to be investigating
an attempted murder.

138
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,191
Why don't you try to solve the mystery
of who put that mud in the freezer?

139
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,597
- Who wants chocolate ice cream?
- Me! Me! Me, me!

140
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,861
Okay, boys, we've got a clue-

141
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,964
the bullet they took out of Burns.

142
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:07,535
Now, let's discuss
the, um, "mo-tive. "

143
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,946
<i>Mr. Burns is the richest man in town.
Maybe it's about money.</i>

144
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,984
- That's some good thinking, Lou.
- Oh, thanks, Chief.

145
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,952
Hey, I said that.
My name is Lisa Simpson.

146
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,455
And I made a chart of all the suspects
in the Burns case.

147
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,187
Look. Mr. Burns hurt
all these people financially.

148
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,195
<i>Nightclub owner,
Moe Syzslak.</i>

149
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,765
<i>His bar was closed
because of Burns's negligence.</i>

150
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,766
<i>Liquor connoisseur,
Barney Gumble.</i>

151
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,393
<i>When Moe's closed,
Barney lost his only means of support-</i>

152
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,904
<i>sucking coins out of
the love tester machine.</i>

153
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,769
That's a real good way to get sick.

154
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,366
<i>Dedicated educator Principal Seymour Skinner.</i>

155
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,878
<i>His school lost millions
when Burns pirated its oil well.</i>

156
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,745
<i>And grounds tender, Groundskeeper Willie,
he lost his job...</i>

157
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,081
<i>and his dream of owning
a fine crystal slop bucket.</i>

158
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,212
Hey, what about that jazz teacher
that got laid off?

159
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,814
You know, uh, Mr. Samba, Senor Mambo.
What was it?

160
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,825
- Tito Puente?
- Yeah.

161
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,020
Well, he did vow revenge.

162
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,431
But I can't see him
doing something illegal.

163
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,866
- He's in show business. He's a celebrity.
- Let's roll, boys.

164
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,599
Revenge? Of course.
But why wound his body with bullets...

165
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,043
when I could set his soul afire
with a slanderous mambo?

166
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,637
Listen, if you will, to my revenge.

167
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,910
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

168
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:23,580
Wounds won't last long
But an insulting song

169
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:28,183
Burns will always
carry with him

170
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,321
<i>So I settle my score
on the salsa floor</i>

171
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,197
<i>With this vengeful
Latin rhythm</i>

172
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,635
Burns

173
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,074
<i>Con el corazón de perro</i>

174
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,112
Senor Burns

175
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,149
<i>El diablo con dinero</i>

176
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,455
It may not surprise you

177
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,546
But all of us despise you

178
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,649
<i>Please die</i>

179
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,992
<i>And fry in hell</i>

180
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,224
<i>You rotten</i>

181
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:12,168
Rich old wretch

182
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,339
<i>Adios viejo</i>

183
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,776
- Oh, olé.
- Yeah!

184
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,711
Okay, okay,
I believe you're innocent.

185
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,408
Gee, I hope all of the suspects
are this much fun.

186
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,680
<i>Hmm.</i>

187
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:32,520
Now- Now let-

188
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,117
Let me-
Let me think.

189
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,492
Now I did-

190
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,556
I did go to the town meeting
with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns.

191
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:46,229
When it adjourned,
I rushed to the lavatory...

192
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,670
to apply my camouflage makeup.

193
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,208
Blast! I took mother's makeup kit
by mistake.

194
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,210
Oh, uh, excuse me, ma'am.

195
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,678
Superintendent Chalmers.

196
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,807
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

197
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,478
So, Superintendent Chalmers
can vouch for your whereabouts?

198
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,454
Oh, yes. But anything else
he tells you is a filthy lie.

199
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,220
I'm telling you,
I could nay have shot Burns.

200
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,954
This is your last warning
about that.

201
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,932
It's impossible for me
to fire a pistol.

202
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,162
If you'll check
my medical records...

203
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,502
you'll see I have a crippling arthritis
in me index fingers.

204
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:27,341
Look at 'em!
Oh, I got it from Space Invaders in 1977.

205
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,847
- Oh, yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game.
- Video game?

206
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,145
- Do you hold a grudge against Montgomery Burns?
- No.

207
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,153
All right, maybe I did, but I didn't shoot him.

208
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,621
Checks out. Okay, sir, you're free to go.

209
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,817
Good, 'cause I got a hot date tonight.

210
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,915
A date.

211
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,221
Dinner with friends.

212
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,227
Dinner alone.

213
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,093
Watching TV alone.

214
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,666
All right!
I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies...

215
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,101
in the Victoria Secret Catalog.

216
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,535
Sears Catalog.

217
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,869
Now would you unhook
this already, please?

218
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,535
I don't deserve this kind of shabby treatment.

219
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,171
Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up
in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there.

220
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,217
- Have you seen it?
- You accuse me of everything around here.

221
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,843
"Who put slippers in the dishwasher?"

222
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,445
"Who threw a cane at the TV?"

223
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,117
"Who fell into the china hutch?"

224
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,126
I was just asking if you'd seen it.

225
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,355
There's no need
to be a prickly pear.

226
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,524
Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby.

227
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,534
I missed you bad.

228
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,536
Were you talking to me, Grampa?

229
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,074
- Um, yes.
- Eww!

230
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:34,579
We're still not close.
Boy, this is gonna be an all-night brain-buster.

231
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,580
Well, better drink some coffee.

232
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:42,451
We're out of coffee.
Well, I'll just drink this warm cream.

233
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,108
Huh?

234
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,647
I'm not following you.

235
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,285
Huh?

236
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,364
Look at Burns's suit!
Yeesh!

237
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,923
- What? Oh! Oh.
- I had an idea, Chief.

238
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,526
Why don't we check out that suit
Burns was wearing when he got shot?

239
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,163
Did you have the same backwards-talking dream
with the flaming cards?

240
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,741
I'll drive.

241
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,136
Eureka!

242
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,650
- Ooh, nice eyelash. Yours?
- No.

243
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,243
We need to find out who it belonged to.
We want a D.N.A. test.

244
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:53,451
Ooh, ooh, hey, ooh, oh.
That takes eight to 10 weeks.

245
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,495
Did I say weeks? 'Cause I meant seconds.

246
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,965
What do you got,
the whole town's D.N.A. on file?

247
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,594
Yuh-huh. If you've ever handled a penny,
the government's got your D.N.A.

248
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,468
Why do you think they keep them in circulation?
The scan's finished.

249
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,475
Now it's gonna narrow it down
to the family bloodline.

250
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,748
- Homer Simpson!
- Bingo.

251
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,624
- The gunman has a name-o.
- Chief! Chief!

252
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,293
Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing?
What's going on?

253
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,229
I'm sorry, kid.
We got Simpson D.N.A. on Burns's clothing...

254
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,857
and your father was identified
by the old man himself.

255
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,069
D.N.A. Positive I.D.

256
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,162
D.N.A. Positive I.D.

257
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,331
- Those won't hold up in any court. Run, Dad!
- Hey, ho!

258
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,909
Look what I found
under Mr. Simpson's car seat.

259
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,939
I swear, I've never seen
that gun before.

260
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,948
They why are your fingerprints
all over it, sir?

261
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,385
This bullet matches the one
we took out of Burns.

262
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,426
Homer Simpson, you're under arrest
for attempted murder.

263
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,326
- D'oh!
- Yeah, that's what they all say.

264
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,331
They all say, "D'oh. "

265
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,801
Yeah, we need
two cups of coffee...

266
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,242
and two orders of bite-sized
breakfast pancakes, with extra dipping sauce.

267
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,871
Please pull up to the service window, please.

268
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,917
The wagon's too tall.
Oh, I don't wanna have to get out.

269
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,918
I'll just drive up on the curb.

270
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,918
Blughh.

271
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,051
<i>- Almost got it.
- Drop the food, Chief!</i>

272
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,895
Dang fools.
Drive-through's not for a-parkin'.

273
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,769
Diane, I'm going
to take my break now.

274
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,870
Hi, everybody!

275
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,846
Ho... mer Simp... son.

276
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,884
Okay, that was a little strange.

277
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,148
Um, tell me,
how you feeling today?

278
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,450
Homer... Simpson. Homer.

279
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,457
D'oh, Simpson.

280
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,790
Hmm, that seems
to be all you can say.

281
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:15,060
When you were in that coma,
did you feel your brain getting damaged?

282
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,102
The police have such
a strong case against Homer.

283
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,262
Mr. Burns said he did it.
They have Homer's D.N.A.

284
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,535
They have Simpson D.N.A.
It could have come from any of us.

285
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,542
Except you,
since you're a Bouvier.

286
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,874
No, no, no,
when I took your father's name...

287
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,642
I took everything that came with it,
including D.N.A.

288
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,741
Okay, Mom.
Anyway, my point is...

289
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,286
the evidence isn't as concrete
as it seems.

290
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:41,087
Like those fingerprints. They could have
gotten on the gun some other way.

291
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,525
Are you sure you don't want me
to hold one of your ice-cream cones?

292
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,529
Yeah, right.

293
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,929
You chose fruit.
You live with fruit.

294
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:52,094
D'oh! You- Oh!
No. No. No.

295
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,173
Eww! Why is this
on the floor?

296
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,908
And we don't even know
whose gun that was.

297
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,378
Maybe somebody planted it there
to frame Dad.

298
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,212
No. We can't start thinking that way
about our own family members.

299
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,616
Suspicion could tear us apart.

300
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,417
That's right.
We all gotta stick together...

301
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,756
if we're gonna have any hope
of bringing that awful Homer to justice.

302
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:21,322
Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.

303
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,927
And now Waylon Smithers, who's been a
real good sport about that wrongful arrest thing-

304
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,030
has a statement that he would like to make.

305
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,041
- Waylon.
- Thank you.

306
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,544
As Montgomery Burns's closest friend,
I'm certain there is nothing he would want more...

307
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,877
than swift, brutal revenge
against Homer Simpson.

308
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:42,147
Therefore, I am offering
a $50,000 reward for his capture.

309
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,712
- Dead or alive.
- Holy cow! Me first! Me first!

310
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,689
<i>Homer Simpson?</i>

311
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,887
So, you finally learned
my name, eh?

312
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,089
Homer Simpson.

313
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,428
I've got no time
for your demented parlor games.

314
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,994
You won't be telling anyone else
that Homer Simpson shot you.

315
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:08,276
The scene of the crime.
There must be something here that can clear Dad.

316
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,372
- Clue. Clue.
- That's it.

317
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,850
Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd kiss you
if you weren't swimming with disease.

318
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,791
So, the D.N.A. was right.

319
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,769
- It must have been- Oh, Dad!
- Attention, all units.

320
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,738
Homer Simpson has been sighted. Proceed
at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital.

321
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,079
Be careful when we capture him.

322
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,082
We cannot claim the reward
unless we have 51% of the carcass.

323
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:56,455
Stop! Don't shoot my dad!

324
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,588
He's innocent.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

325
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,959
- Homer Simpson.
- Stop telling them it was me!

326
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,528
- I'll kill you for saying it was me!
- Homer Simpson.

327
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,903
What is the meaning of this?

328
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,169
Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?

329
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,269
D'oh!

330
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,077
Say it, Burns! Say I never shot you...

331
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,344
before.

332
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,249
Shot? By you?

333
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,515
I'm afraid not, my primitive friend.

334
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,921
Your kind has neither
the cranial capacity...

335
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,493
nor the opposable digits
to operate a firearm.

336
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,723
The one who shot me was-

337
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,896
M-Maggie Simpson!

338
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:44,242
With the sun-blocker in place
and the town aghast, I was on top of the world.

339
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,744
<i>So, I wanted to kick up my heels
and indulge my sweet tooth.</i>

340
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,679
I feel like celebrating.

341
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,354
Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?
I see.

342
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,958
<i>Yes.</i>

343
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,054
That's the one. Smithers had thwarted
my earlier attempt to take candy from a baby.

344
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:11,158
But with him out of the picture,
I was free to wallow in my own crapulence.

345
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,170
I think you'd better drop it.

346
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,172
<i>But the old axiom was misleading.</i>

347
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,708
<i>Taking the candy proved
exceedingly difficult.</i>

348
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:22,906
I said drop it!

349
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,117
<i>Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid.</i>

350
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,660
<i>But finding only
slack-jawed gawkers...</i>

351
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,855
<i>I gave up and collapsed
on the sundial.</i>

352
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,364
Then with your last
ounce of strength...

353
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,526
you pointed to "W" and "S."

354
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,231
Or, from your point of view,
"M" and "S."

355
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,104
- Maggie Simpson.
- What? No!

356
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:55,908
With my last ounce of strength,
I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them.

357
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,073
Those paramedics have sticky fingers.

358
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,845
Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe
and that you've recovered...

359
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,977
and we can all
get back to normal.

360
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,818
If Maggie could talk,
I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you.

361
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:10,156
I'm afraid that's insufficient.
Officer, arrest the baby.

362
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,730
Yeah, right, Pops.

363
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,356
No jury in the world's
gonna convict a baby.

364
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,367
Hmm, maybe Texas.

365
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,632
Besides, she didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

366
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,889
Shh!
