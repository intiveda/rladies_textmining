00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,478
D'oh!

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,724
<i>Testing. Testing for Mr. Burns.</i>

4
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,093
<i>Here you go, sir. I've warmed up
the crowd for you.</i>

5
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,291
"Welcome, employees. "

6
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,733
"Come in. "

7
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,997
"The whole night's
entertainment is on me. "

8
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:45,276
"Monty Burns. "

9
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,039
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

10
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,878
<i>To an evening of exciting quarter-mile action.!
Action.! Action.!</i>

11
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,284
<i>Our first race is a benefit for daredevil
Lance Murdock.! Murdock.! Murdock.!</i>

12
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,415
Who's hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver!
Liver! Liver!

13
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,222
All right! Liver!

14
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,556
<i>- It sure would be fun to carpool
in one of those, huh, kids?</i>

15
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,931
<i>I'd be a real hotrod mama, wouldn't I?</i>

16
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,869
- Huh? Huh?
- You missed the race, Mama.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,965
Hmm. I wish I'd pay more attention.

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,309
Smithers, this beer isn't working.

19
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,644
I don't feel any younger or funkier.

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,150
<i>- I'll switch to the tablespoon, sir.
- Coming up next.!</i>

21
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,746
Our feature race- the Nuclear Power Plant
Championship! Plant! Plant!

22
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:35,260
Ah! At last.
Smithers, fetch the bi-oculars.

23
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,294
- Damnation! Tell them to go slower.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,064
Hi, guys.

25
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,765
Could we keep it in first gear
for a couple laps?

26
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,875
<i>Go.! Go.!</i>

27
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,576
Slow down.

28
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,349
<i>Excellent.</i>

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,099
This novelty foam hand
is ludicrously oversized.

30
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,099
Go swap it for a smaller one.

31
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,829
It is a bit ostentatious, sir.
I'll be right back.

32
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,238
Hey, Burnsie!
This was some swell shindig.

33
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,369
- Thank you very much.
- Smithers! What's happening?

34
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,414
I had a great time.
I just wanna shake your hand.

35
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,945
You're the greatest.

36
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,350
Smithers! Help!

37
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,650
Doesn't seem as funny to me.
But what do I know?

38
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,816
<i>Smithers.!</i>

39
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,587
Oh, my God!

40
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,822
Hey-hey!

41
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,794
You should've seen the murderous glint
in his eyes, Smithers.

42
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,205
And his breath reeked of beer
and pretzled bread.

43
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,777
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.
This was all my fault.

44
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,778
No. Don't concern yourself.

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,644
If things had turned ugly,
I always had my mace.

46
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,014
<i>Don't let me off the hook
that easily, sir.</i>

47
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,314
I failed you,
and I'll never forgive myself.

48
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,321
Never! Never! Never!

49
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,391
Never! Never! Never!

50
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,390
Never! Never! Never!

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,701
Good morning, sir. To make up
for my failure last night...

52
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,703
I've alphabetized your breakfast.

53
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,501
You can start with the waffles
and work your way up to the zwieback.

54
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,872
And to prevent newsprint
from rubbing off on your hands...

55
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,877
I've laminated today's newspaper.

56
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,641
I appreciate the thought,
but my pen won't write on this.

57
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,648
How am I supposed to do
the "JuniorJumble"?

58
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,378
Oh! I can't even grovel properly.
I'm a buffoon.

59
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,981
I don't deserve to live
on your planet anymore!

60
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,618
Agh!

61
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,563
Pull yourself together, man.

62
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,602
I daresay you're in need
of a long vacation.

63
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,604
No! Don't make me take a vacation.

64
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,970
Without you, I'll wither and die!

65
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,670
- That's a risk I'm willing to take.
- What would you do without me?

66
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,009
I'm not a baby
who needs a nursemaid to burp me.

67
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,015
You see?

68
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,812
Now, I insist you take a vacation...

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,854
just as soon as a temporary substitute
can be found.

70
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,855
<i>Sheesh.!</i>

71
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,620
I've got to find a replacement
who won't outshine me.

72
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,794
Perhaps if I search the employee evaluations
for the word "incompetent. "

73
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,893
<i>714 names?</i>

74
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,996
Better be more specific.

75
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,076
Lazy. Clumsy.

76
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,076
Dimwitted.

77
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,078
Monstrously ugly.

78
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,217
<i>Nuts to this.
I'll just go get Homer Simpson.</i>

79
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:49,721
<i>I think Smithers picked me
because of my motivational skills.</i>

80
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,757
Everyone always says they have to work
a lot harder when I'm around.

81
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,454
You know, Dad, assisting Mr. Burns could
give your career a real shot in the arm.

82
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:00,794
You know, Homer, assisting Mr. Burns could
give your career a real shot in the arm.

83
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,392
- Mom, I just said that.
- Sor-ry.

84
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,495
Next time,
get your own darn corn.

85
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,767
Um, is this the chair
I'll be sitting on?

86
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,709
Yeah. Now, I realize caring for Mr. Burns
seems like a big job...

87
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,939
but actually it's just 2,800 small jobs.

88
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,879
Uh-huh.
But this is the chair, right?

89
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,611
Your new duties will include
answering Mr. Burns's phone...

90
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,619
preparing his tax return,
moistening his eyeballs...

91
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,621
assisting with his chewing
and swallowing...

92
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,782
lying to Congress
and some light typing.

93
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,190
Montgomery Burns's office.

94
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,354
Oh, hello, Mrs. Burns.
I'll see if your son is available.

95
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:35,161
Mr. Burns has a mother?
She must be a hundred million years old.

96
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,329
She has limited capacities.
All she can do is dial and yell.

97
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,930
I'm sorry. Monty can't come
to the phone right now.

98
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,442
He's in a very important meeting
and can't be disturbed.

99
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:53,048
Uh-huh. Okay,
I'll give him the message.

100
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,382
Mr. Burns can't stand
talking to his mother.

101
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,582
He never forgave her
for having that affair with President Taft.

102
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,956
Taft, you old dog.

103
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,732
Really, Smithers, I'll be fine.

104
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,530
I'm sure your replacement
will be able to handle everything.

105
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,161
- Who is he anyway?
- Uh, Homer Simpson, sir.

106
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,331
<i>One of your organ banks
from Sector 7G.</i>

107
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,875
All the recent events
of your life...

108
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,877
have revolved around him
in some way.

109
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,674
Simpson, eh?

110
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,341
<i>Uh, Mr. Smithers.!</i>

111
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,078
I don't understand
2,700 of my new duties.

112
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,349
Well, the van's leaving. Which one duty
is giving you the most trouble?

113
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,187
Um, what do I do in case of fire?

114
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,420
Sorry. Can't hear you. Bye.

115
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,835
Aw! Just my luck.

116
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,212
Good Lord, Smithers!

117
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,509
You look atrocious.
I thought I told you to take a vacation.

118
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,451
Smithers already left, sir.
I'm his replacement- Homer Simpson.

119
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,785
Ah, yes. Simpson.
I'll have my lunch now.

120
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,859
A single pillow of shredded wheat...

121
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,359
some steamed toast
and a dodo egg.

122
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,623
- But I think the dodo went extinct-
- Get going!

123
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,961
And answer those phones,
install the computer system...

124
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,296
and rotate my office
so the window faces the hills.

125
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,235
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay.

126
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,932
Um, can you repeat
the part of the stuff...

127
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,238
where you said all about
the... things?

128
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,437
Uh, the things?

129
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,093
Lousy two-legged pants.

130
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,959
Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning.

131
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,964
<i>Little Rascals isn't on till 6:00.</i>

132
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,900
I'm taping it. I wanna get to Mr. Burns's house
bright and early to make his breakfast.

133
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,164
Oh, poor Homie.

134
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,298
Poor, poor-

135
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,246
Hmm. One of these
must be a breakfast maker.

136
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,948
Well, it's my job
to cook him breakfast...

137
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,686
and I'm gonna cook
the best damn breakfast he ever ate.

138
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,297
Hmm.

139
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:26,466
Hmm.

140
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,282
Doughnuts? I told you
I don't like ethnic food.

141
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,479
Here. Tell me how my stocks
did yesterday.

142
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,387
Uh, they all won.

143
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,928
- Hmm? What about my options?
- Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep.

144
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,758
I believe I'll get up.

145
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,025
<i>Scrub harder.</i>

146
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,569
<i>Got to get that layer of dead skin off.</i>

147
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:03,073
I think... the fangs today.

148
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,074
<i>Simpson?</i>

149
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,083
<i>Simpson.</i>

150
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,085
- Did you get that report on the accounting department?
- Yes, sir, I did.

151
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,988
"The accounting department
is located on the third floor.

152
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,186
Its hours are 9:00 a. m.
to 5:00 p. m."

153
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,754
The head of this department
is a Mr. Johnson orJohnstone.

154
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,562
Here are your messages.
"You have 30 minutes to move your car. "

155
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,766
"You have 10 minutes. "
"Your car has been impounded. "

156
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,435
"Your car has been
crushed into a cube. "

157
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,342
"You have 30 minutes to move your cube. "

158
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,779
- Y'ello. Mr. Burns's office.
- Is it about my cube?

159
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,942
It's Mr. Smithers.
He's calling for you.

160
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,577
How's everything
going there, sir? Heh.

161
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,781
I have a lot of free time
on my hands.

162
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,654
If you FedEx me your mail, I'd be happy
to open it and return it to you.

163
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,852
Everything's fine, Smithers.

164
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,430
This Simpson fellow seems
to be getting dumber by the minute.

165
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,864
I've never seen anything quite like it.
Anyhoo, you just enjoy your vacation.

166
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,566
Look alive, Simpson!
I'm not paying you to goldbrick.

167
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,972
Yes! Yes, sir!

168
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,841
Get cracking on my long division,
and don't forget to show your work, Simpson.

169
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,846
I'll have it on your desk
in the morning, sir.

170
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,973
Bart! Leave Simpson alone.

171
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,075
- Simpson, I need a ride to the library.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,677
Kids! Stop exploiting your father.

173
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,949
Homie, why don't you
lie down and relax?

174
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:29,084
No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns
wants me to do some long division.

175
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,753
Simpson! Lie down!

176
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,957
Sorry, but you need
a good night's rest.

177
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,330
<i>Simpson.!</i>

178
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,444
The telephone has been ringing for some time.

179
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,514
Answer it.

180
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,482
Y'ello. It's for you.

181
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,486
<i>"Relax"]
- Mr. Burns- 48 rings. Are you all right?</i>

182
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,488
What did Simpson do to you?

183
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,048
Do? Nothing other than drive me
to distraction with his incompetent boobery.

184
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,788
Terrible at everything.
A complete moron.

185
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,831
But I'm not really free to talk right now.

186
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,901
Look. Stop calling me
and start enjoying your vacation.

187
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,028
Remember, I want to see
lots of pictures when you get back.

188
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,905
Uh, actually, sir, picture taking
is not allowed at this particular resort.

189
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,534
Oop. I gotta go now.
There's a line forming behind me.

190
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,545
Sixty watts?

191
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,647
What do you think this is,
a tanning salon?

192
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,249
<i>I asked for light starch
on my nightcap!</i>

193
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,290
You call this Postum?

194
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,764
You call this a tax return?

195
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,028
<i>You call this a supercomputer?</i>

196
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,765
D'egh! G'yah! D'oh!

197
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,240
You're a travesty of a f-
joke of an assistant!

198
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,094
Is there something wrong, Homie?

199
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,565
- No.
- Except-

200
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,502
Except... I killed Mr. Burns!

201
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:23,666
- What happened, Dad?
- I punched Burns right in his 104-year-old face.

202
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,404
Are you sure he's dead?
Maybe you just really, really hurt him.

203
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,447
Okay. Maybe everything's all right.

204
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:34,315
Maybe, if you go apologize,
he won't even fire you... if he's alive.

205
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,221
Mr. Burns?

206
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,602
I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns.

207
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,730
Here. Let me put some salt
on that eye.

208
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,070
No! Please! I can't bear
another thrashing.

209
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,667
- Just leave me be.
- Yes, sir.

210
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,848
Must... call... Smithers.

211
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,850
He'll protect me from this beast.

212
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,887
I've seen people activate
this machine a thousand times.

213
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,685
Doesn't seem to be any trick to it.
Let's see. Smithers.

214
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,626
S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S.

215
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,197
Success! It's ringing.

216
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,198
Moe's Tavern.

217
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,201
I'm looking for a Mr. Smithers,
first name Waylon.

218
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,706
Oh. So you're lookin'
for a Mr. Smithers, eh?

219
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,777
First name Waylon, is it?
Listen to me, you!

220
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:35,574
When I catch you, I'm gonna pull out your eyes
and shove 'em down your pants...

221
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,581
so you can watch me
kick the crap outta you!

222
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,379
Okay? Then I'm gonna
use your tongue to paint my boat.

223
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,046
Ooh.

224
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,088
Oh, Smithers,
if only you could hear me.

225
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,395
Something tells me
Mr. Burns needs me.

226
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,759
Something tells me
Mr. Burns needs me.

227
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,628
Praise God. That thug has finally
gone home for the day.

228
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,900
Now I can make my escape.

229
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,601
Hi, Mr. Burns. You want your coffee now?

230
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,508
No. I'm, uh, making it myself.

231
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,808
Hear that?

232
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,112
The percolations are imminent.
No need to come in.

233
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,188
Cease your ingress.

234
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,359
Stay back, Homer.
Approach no further.

235
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,759
Coffee's already made.
I stomped the beans myself.

236
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,061
Well, can I at least drive you home,
Mr. Burns? It's 5:00.

237
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,603
<i>No! I thought- I thought
I'd chauffeur myself this evening.</i>

238
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,571
Yes. That's what I thought.
How difficult can it be?

239
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,471
I'm sure the manual will indicate
which lever is the velocitator...

240
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,136
and which the deceleratrix, hmm?

241
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,714
I can't believe it.

242
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,750
All my life, I've avoided
doing things for myself.

243
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,150
But I'm actually enjoying this.
Plus I'm making incredible time.

244
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,348
Beep-beep! Out of my way!

245
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,255
I'm a motorist.

246
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,885
Uh, that's some nice
reckless drivin', Mr. B.

247
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,161
Would you like me to shred
those environmental reports for you, sir?

248
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,136
Already taken care of.

249
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,206
Cappuccino, Simpson?

250
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,601
Ahoy! Ahoy!
No, you have the wrong number.

251
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,611
This is 5246.

252
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:18,080
I suspect you need more practice
working your telephone machine.

253
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,515
Not at all. Ahoy.

254
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,247
Mr. Burns, is there anything
at all I can do for you?

255
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:27,382
No, Homer. You've already
done more for me than any man.

256
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,223
Your brutal attack forced me
to fend for myself.

257
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:35,130
I realize now that being waited on hand and foot
is okay for your average joe.

258
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,135
But it's not for me.
I want to thank you.

259
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,669
Thank you.
Thank you.

260
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,605
Thank you.

261
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,837
Oh, my God! I knew
I shouldn't have left.

262
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,937
Ah! Welcome back, Smithers.

263
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,984
Say, do you know Homer Simpson? He pitched in
around the office while you were away.

264
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,851
Bang-up job, Simpson, but I guess
it's back to your trusty post in Sector 7G.

265
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,290
You heard the man, Simpson.

266
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,589
Ah, and my dear, dear Smithers.

267
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,596
You're no longer needed at all.

268
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,598
You're fired. Ta.

269
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,595
You shouldn't have
gone away on vacation.

270
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,414
- Cheer up, Homie.
- I feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired.

271
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,384
That job was all he had.
Imagine how you'd feel, Marge...

272
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,785
if you got fired from the-

273
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,722
those things that... you do.

274
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,488
Quick, Mom. Whip up a cake
before Dad fires ya.

275
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,393
Don't worry, Dad.
Mr. Smithers is a resilient man.

276
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,797
I'm sure he can get a great job
at any corporation he wants.

277
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,009
<i>Meet your new piano mover.</i>

278
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,409
We're gonna have to put a steel rod
where your spine was.

279
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,643
Will I ever move a piano again?

280
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,652
Oh, my goodness gracious! No.

281
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,654
Get ready for exciting quarter-mile action...

282
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,656
at the Springfield Drag Strip!

283
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,783
It'll be motorized mayhem!
Mayhem! Mayhem!

284
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,020
Do we need
all those "mayhems"? We do.

285
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,461
All right. Fair enough.
I suppose you know your business.

286
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,226
Get ready for fun! Fun! Fun!

287
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,234
Uh, people are already here.

288
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,835
We don't need to keep hustling them
like this, do we?

289
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,908
- Will you let go of me?
Where are you throwing me?

290
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,308
Uh, hello. Is that a "Help Wanted" sign
in the window?

291
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,609
Uh, yeah. I need someone to help me
with the midnight beer delivery.

292
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,482
Your job is to distract Barney
until it's safely off the truck.

293
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,417
I'll just wait out back until then.

294
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,980
- I look forward to workin' with ya.
- Mr. Smithers! Wait!

295
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,756
You can't let yourself end up in a place
like this. You've got two choices.

296
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,663
You can give up on yourself
and take the Barney-guarding job-

297
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,930
like so many of us have contemplated
in our darkest moments-

298
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,871
or you can admit to yourself there's only
one person that can make you happy...

299
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,738
and do whatever it takes
to get them back!

300
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,744
You're right!

301
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,178
<i>But I'm gonna need your help.</i>

302
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,580
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

303
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,619
<i>Beer delivery. Sign here.</i>

304
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,620
<i>No.! It's you.!</i>

305
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,417
<i>Oh, boy.!</i>

306
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,685
<i>Gimme that.!</i>

307
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,632
Okay. I gotcha covered.

308
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,537
Mr. Burns may have mastered
2,799 of my 2,800 duties...

309
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,370
but I'll wager dollars to doughnuts...

310
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,377
he still can't handle
a call from his mother.

311
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,674
You're on!

312
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,917
What?

313
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,179
Hello. Mrs. Burns.
This is Waylon Smithers.

314
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,187
I have your son,
Montgomery, on the line.

315
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,655
That improvident lackwit!

316
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:50,660
Always too busy stridin' about his atom mill
to call his own mother.

317
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:54,289
I'll give him what for
till he cries brassafrax!

318
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,393
Perfect.

319
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,301
When I give the signal,
you transfer the call to Mr. Burns.

320
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,431
- After she tears into him, I'll rush in and save the day.
- Got it.

321
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:11,105
- I'm transferring a call in to you, Mr. Burns.
- No problemo.

322
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,242
<i>Uh, ooh. Um.</i>

323
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,821
Uh-oh.

324
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,323
<i>Ahoy, ahoy. Ahoy.</i>

325
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,952
Hello. Mr. Burns? This is your mother.

326
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,927
No!

327
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,159
Oh, hello, Mater.

328
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,431
Um, sorry about pulling the plug
on you and all.

329
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,768
Who could have known
you'd pull through and...

330
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,898
live for another five decades.

331
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,909
Ooh! Is my face red.

332
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:43,072
Mrs. Burns is 122 years old,
so try to sound more desiccated.

333
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,810
And she doesn't
call her son "Mr. Burns. "

334
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,979
Son, this is Mrs. Burns.

335
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,524
I just called to say
I don't love you.

336
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,389
You are a bad son, Montel-

337
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,395
So.

338
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,761
Impersonate my mother, will you?

339
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,562
And you, Smithers,
you must have put him up to it.

340
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,365
I'm glad I fired you.

341
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,235
You really blew it this time,
Smithers.

342
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,041
Stop that! Stop that at once!
You're fighting!

343
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,783
- Stop fighting like a girl, Simpson!
- Okay.

344
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,555
<i>Stop it.!
Stop it, I say.!</i>

345
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,438
I'll teach you how
to use a phone, you boob!

346
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,337
- Ring! Ring! Ring!
- D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

347
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,069
- It's for you.
- D'oh!

348
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,010
I'll show you!

349
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,261
Oh, my.

350
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,924
Here comes the endangered condor
into the power lines.

351
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,028
- Mm. Mm. Mm.
- I've got Bobo, hot from the dryer.

352
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,039
Careful not to burn yourself
on his eye.

353
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,109
I don't need you to do any of this.

354
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,008
I'm totally self-reliant now.

355
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,013
What I would like, though,
is a spanish peanut.

356
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,677
Skin.

357
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,212
Mm-mmm-mmm!

358
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,586
It's a remarkable thing.
In the short time you were gone...

359
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:37,458
I learned to be completely
self-reli- ant.

360
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:41,862
Oh, and as for that brutish fellow
who knocked me out the window...

361
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,992
see that he gets
what's coming to him.

362
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,127
I already have, sir.

363
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,263
<i>What'd you get that for?</i>

364
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,307
For knocking Mr. Burns
out of a third-story window.

365
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,570
- Makes sense to me.
- Did he die?

366
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,646
What am I, a doctor?

367
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,361
Shh!
