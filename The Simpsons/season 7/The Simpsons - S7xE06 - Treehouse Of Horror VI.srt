1
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,861
Ah, the Miracle Mile,
where value wears a neon sombrero...

2
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,267
<i>and there's not a single church
or library to offend the eye.</i>

3
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,839
There it is!

4
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,273
<i>The chain that put the "fat"
in fat Southern sheriffs.!</i>

5
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,904
I want a colossal doughnut,
just like the one on the sign.

6
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,879
D'oh! Nuts!

7
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,883
That's false advertising!

8
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,919
Sorry, sir. No refunds.

9
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,784
I paid for a colossal doughnut...

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,951
and I'm gonna get
a colossal doughnut.

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,393
<i>You don't scare us.</i>

12
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:13,195
<i>Astronomers from Tacoma
to Vladivostok havejust reported...</i>

13
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,275
<i>an ionic disturbance
in the vicinity of the Van Allen belt.</i>

14
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,106
<i>Scientists are recommending
that all necessary precautions be taken.</i>

15
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,045
<i>Eggheads. What do they know?</i>

16
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,955
Hee-hee-hee!
I got your doughnut, Lard Lad!

17
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,496
<i>And what are you
gonna do about it?</i>

18
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,980
Homer, where did you get that?

19
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,951
- Get what?
- That giant doughnut.

20
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,650
Well, I acquired it legally.
You can be sure of that.

21
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,657
Dude, you're huge!

22
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,666
Yeah!
Let's party, baby!

23
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,531
Hey-hey-hey!

24
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,204
Fellas, where you going at this hour?

25
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,542
Hey, don't scratch up them heads!

26
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,548
Good morning, everybody.

27
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,552
Panic is gripping Springfield as giant
advertising mascots rampage through the city.

28
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,555
Perhaps it's part of
some daring new ad campaign.

29
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,558
But what new product could
justify such carnage? A cleanser?

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,561
A fat-free fudge cake that doesn't
let you down in the flavor department...

31
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,097
like so many others-

32
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,033
Let me go! No! Stop! No!

33
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,973
Whoa!
Another acid flashback.

34
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,703
Man, I'd hate to be
driving a bus right now!

35
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,625
Aw, they're not so tough.

36
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:18,458
Chief, that wasn't a monster. That was the
captain of the high school basketball team.

37
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,762
Uh, yeah, well, he was turning
into a monster though.

38
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,101
What are you waiting for?
Wreck the school. You know you wanna.

39
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,005
- I agree. Destroy the school.
- Hmm.

40
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,141
Hello? Yes?
Oh.

41
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:43,154
If you're looking for that
big doughnut of yours, Flanders has it.

42
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,224
Just smash open his house.

43
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,692
<i>He came to life. Good for him!</i>

44
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,835
<i>Help me, Lord.!</i>

45
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,838
I told you, Flanders has it!

46
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,306
Or Moe. Go kill Moe.

47
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:08,005
Just give him the doughnut! Once he has it,
that will be the end of all this horror!

48
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,515
Well, okay.
If it'll end horror.

49
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,097
Don't you ever get tired of
being wrong all the time?

50
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,099
Sometimes.

51
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,609
These monsters are destroying everything
and everyone we hold dear!

52
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,617
And you kids should have jackets on.

53
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,812
Hey! What's that in his footprint?

54
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,488
Hmm.

55
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,154
<i>If your advertising agency
created all those giant characters...</i>

56
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,163
you must know how to stop them.

57
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,098
Well, sir, advertising is a funny thing.

58
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,728
If people stop paying attention to it,
pretty soon it goes away.

59
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,739
- Like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?
- Exactly!

60
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,368
If you stop paying attention to the monsters,
they'll lose their powers.

61
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,878
But people can't help looking at them.
They're wrecking the town.

62
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,741
You know,
maybe a jingle would help.

63
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,343
Don't watch the mon-

64
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,448
Don't watch the... monsters-s-s-s

65
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,551
Well, it'll sound a lot better
coming out of Paul Anka.

66
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,222
<i>Hey, Springfield.!</i>

67
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,894
<i>Are you suffering from
the heartbreak of monsteritis?</i>

68
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,598
Then take a tip from Mr. Paul Anka!

69
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,074
To stop those monsters one, two, three

70
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,577
<i>Here's a fresh new way
that's trouble-free</i>

71
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,479
It's got Paul Anka's guarantee

72
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,847
Guarantee void in Tennessee

73
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,580
Just don't look
Just don't look

74
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,887
Just don't look
Just don't look

75
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,962
Just don't look
Just don't look

76
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,908
It worked!
They're all dead!

77
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,104
<i>Well, except for chubsy-ubsy over there.</i>

78
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,350
Mmm. Sprinkles!

79
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,010
- Homer, stop looking!
- Don't make us poke your eyes out, Dad.

80
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,587
Ohh!

81
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,525
Here comes something.

82
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,063
Remember the story.
We're newlyweds on our way to Earth capital.

83
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,998
Oh, shazbatt!

84
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,036
Even as I speak, the scourge of advertising
could be heading toward your town!

85
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,402
Lock your doors!
Bar your windows!

86
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:52,240
Because the next advertisement you see
could destroy your house and eat your family.

87
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,142
We'll be right back.

88
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,317
Okay, boy.
Catch the Frisbee.

89
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,688
Good catch, boy.

90
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,420
Thanks, Bart.

91
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,702
Oh, hard luck.

92
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,877
Glad to "rake" your acquaintance.

93
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,946
It was only a dream.

94
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,049
<i>Bart.! Is that you?</i>

95
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,128
<i>- Yes!
- Take out the garbage.</i>

96
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,530
And then he raked me
across the chest.

97
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:51,592
And the weirdest thing was, it was that
school janitor who mysteriously disappeared!

98
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:54,229
- Groundskeeper Willie!
- Oh, my god!

99
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,570
Bart, Groundskeeper Willie
was in my nightmare too.

100
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,168
But he got me with hedge clippers.

101
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,373
He ran his floor buffer over me!

102
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,384
Children, I couldn't help
monitoring your conversation.

103
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,650
There's no mystery about Willie.
Why, he simply disappeared.

104
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,089
Now, let's have no more curiosity
about this bizarre cover-up.

105
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,995
Remember, class, the worse you do
on this standardized test...

106
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,725
the more funding the school gets,
so don't knock yourselves out.

107
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,131
- You have three hours to-
- Finished!

108
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,763
Then put your head down
on your desk and sit quietly.

109
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,842
Ahh. A duet of pleasures.

110
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,705
I am the Wondrous Wizard of Latin!

111
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,305
I am a dervish of declension
and a conjurer of conjugation...

112
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,317
with a million hit points
and maximum charisma!

113
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,183
<i>Ah-ha! Morire: To die!</i>

114
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,383
<i>Morit: He, she, or it dies!</i>

115
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,757
<i>Moris: You die!</i>

116
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,529
You've mastered a dead tongue!
But can you handle a live one?

117
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,272
Ha-ha!

118
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,278
Wheel him out quietly.

119
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,909
It's best the children don't see him.

120
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,251
Oh, just get it out of here!

121
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,151
<i>Not into the kindergarten!</i>

122
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,559
Mom! Dad!
Martin died at school today!

123
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,566
Ohhh! I don't see what that has to do
with Groundskeeper Willie.

124
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:33,503
Um, we didn't mention
Groundskeeper Willie, Mom.

125
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,476
Kids, it's time we told you the true story
and put your fears to rest.

126
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,243
It's a story of murder and revenge
from beyond the grave.

127
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,514
It all started on the 13th hour
of the 13th day...

128
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,885
<i>of the 13th month.</i>

129
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,255
<i>We were there to discuss the misprinted
calendars the school had purchased.</i>

130
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,853
Lousy "Smarch" weather.

131
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,956
"Do not touch Willie. "
Good advice.

132
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,971
Huh?

133
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,439
- Our next budget item, $12 for doorknob repair.
- Nay!

134
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,214
Recharge fire extinguishers.

135
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,285
- This is a free service of the fire department.
- Nay!

136
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,020
Help! Please help me!

137
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,891
Willie, please!
Mr. Van Houten has the floor.

138
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,795
I, for one, would like to see
the cafeteria menus in advance...

139
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,800
<i>so parents can adjust
their dinner menus accordingly.</i>

140
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:41,168
I don't like the idea of Milhouse
having two spaghetti meals in one day.

141
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:51,315
You'll pay for this
with your children's blood!

142
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,352
Oh, right.
How you gonna get 'em? Skeleton power?

143
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,412
I'll strike where you cannot protect them-

144
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,459
in their dreams!

145
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,958
Bart, don't you realize what this means?
The next time we fall asleep, we could die.

146
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,764
Bah!
Welcome to my world.

147
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,576
<i>Announcer]
On this edition of Asian Market Wrap-up.</i>

148
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,511
<i>There's a volcano waiting
to erupt in the Pacific Rim.</i>

149
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,242
It's nine medium-term,
convertible debentures-

150
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,250
It's no use, Bart.

151
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,718
- We can't stay up forever!
- You're right.

152
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:34,282
The only thing left to do is go into my dream
and force Willie into a final showdown.

153
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,089
You stay awake. And if it looks like
I'm in trouble, wake me up.

154
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,596
Okay. But promise
you won't be grouchy.

155
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,611
Come on, Willie.
I know you're out there.

156
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,886
<i>The sandbox.!</i>

157
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,863
<i>Hey, Lawn Boy.!
You missed a spot.!</i>

158
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,803
When I'm done with you,
they'll have to do a "compost-mortem!"

159
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,417
Sinky sand!

160
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,286
No! Help!

161
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,887
Willie's gone for good.

162
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,095
Now I can get back to my normal dreams-
me and Krusty winning the Super Bowl.

163
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,103
Bart, there's two seconds left.

164
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,106
Listen up. It's your basic
Statue of Liberty play with one twist.

165
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,108
You throw it to me.

166
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,110
Knute Rockne called it
"the forward pass. "

167
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,012
Now, the clock's still running, so it's important
we start this play as quickly as possible.

168
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,017
Oh-ho, boy!

169
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,212
Don't dream about me no more, kid.

170
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,346
Help! Lisa, help!

171
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,789
<i>- Bart, you're in trouble! Wake up!
- Wait a minute.</i>

172
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,521
If you're here,
then you've fallen asleep too.

173
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,326
I'm not asleep.
I'm just resting my eye- Uh-oh.

174
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,299
- Good-bye, Bart.
- Good-bye, Lise.

175
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,034
I hope you get reincarnated as someone
who can stay awake for 15 minutes.

176
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,028
You saved us, Maggie!

177
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,568
I don't know, Bart.

178
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,571
Something tells me Willie's still out there,
and that he could come back...

179
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,972
any time, in any form,
and kill us in ways we can't even imagine!

180
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,246
Boo!

181
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,745
Here I am. Yah!

182
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,119
No! Stop!
I left my gun on the seat!

183
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,124
Hey!

184
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,387
Wait here, please.

185
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,865
Aw, geez!

186
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,401
<i>Homer, get ready.!</i>

187
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,771
<i>Patty and Selma
will be here any minute.!</i>

188
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,574
Oh, no! Better ride
this one out in the closet.

189
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,580
Sorry, Dad.
This is our spot.

190
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,311
Oh, yeah?
Well, it's my house, so it's my spot.

191
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,977
- Nu-uh, because we called it.
- Did not.

192
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,578
- Well, we're calling it now.
- You are?

193
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,715
- 'Fraid so.
- Ohh! They got me with their legal mumbo jumbo!

194
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,395
<i>Just a second.!</i>

195
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,238
Huh? I never looked behind
this whatchamacallit case before.

196
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,101
Huh? That's weird.

197
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,842
It's like something out of
that twilight-y show about that zone.

198
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,851
How's it hangin', Marge?

199
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,116
Yuck! I'm baking like a meat loaf
under this wet wool.

200
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,622
Uh, may I take your coat,
Aunt Selma?

201
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,924
Um, I would also like
to take your coat.

202
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,324
Have we got
a family activity for you!

203
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,063
A pillow case full of seashells
from our trip to Sulfur Bay.

204
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,071
You're gonna help us
clean and organize them.

205
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,768
And pry out all the dead hermit crabs.
Get a screwdriver.

206
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,404
I'll take my chances in the mystery wall!

207
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,985
Oh, glory of glories!

208
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:05,393
Oh, heavenly testament to
the eternal majesty of God's creation!

209
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,590
Holy macaroni!

210
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,434
Hey, you can just suck 'em out.

211
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,373
<i>Hello? Can anybody hear me?</i>

212
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,376
Homer, where are you?

213
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,379
<i>Uh, I'm somewhere
where I don't know where I am.!</i>

214
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,383
Do you see towels? If you see towels,
you're probably in the linen closet again.

215
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,783
<i>Just a second.</i>

216
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,788
<i>No, it's a place
I've never been before.</i>

217
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,289
Uh-huh.
The shower.

218
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,883
<i>Hey.!</i>

219
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,069
I don't want to alarm you, Marge...

220
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,571
<i>but I seem to be trapped in here.</i>

221
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,734
We'd better call Ned. He has a ladder.

222
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,871
What's going on here?
I'm so bulgy.

223
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,278
My stomach sticks way out in front
and my-

224
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,279
Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack,
I'm stumped.

225
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,622
It's like he just
disappeared into fat air.

226
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,697
Hey, shut up!

227
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:28,578
Mmm!
Unprocessed fish sticks.

228
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,123
Man, this place looks expensive!

229
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,857
I feel like I'm wasting a fortune
just standing here.

230
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,266
Better make the most of it.

231
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,599
Ow! Watch it, coney!

232
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,271
Whoops.

233
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,112
<i>- Do you see a light, Homer?
- Yes.</i>

234
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,516
Move into the light, my son.

235
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,520
<i>Ow.!</i>

236
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,523
Homer, this is your physician,
DoctorJulius Hibbert.

237
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,889
Can you tell us
what it's like in there?

238
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,895
Um, it's like, uh-

239
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,488
<i>Did anyone see the movie Tron?</i>

240
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,862
- No. -
No. - No.

241
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:23,992
- No. -
No. - No.

242
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,536
- No. -
No. - No.

243
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,502
- No. -
No. - Yes.

244
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,574
Er, um, I mean, no.
No.

245
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,377
Well, where's my dad?

246
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,846
Well, it should be obvious
to even the most dimwitted individual...

247
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,282
who holds an advanced degree
in hyperbolic topology...

248
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,252
that Homer Simpson
has stumbled into...

249
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,051
the third dimension.

250
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,217
Sorry.

251
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,194
Here is an ordinary square.

252
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,697
Whoa! Whoa!
Slow down, egghead.

253
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,328
But suppose we extend the square beyond
the two dimensions of our universe...

254
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,407
along the hypothetical "Z" axis there.

255
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,703
This forms...

256
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,176
a three-dimensional object
known as a cube...

257
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,181
or a "Frinkahedron," in honor
of its discoverer.

258
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,185
<i>Help me.! Are you helping me?
Or are you going on and on?</i>

259
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,916
Oh, right. And, of course,
within we find the doomed individual.

260
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,859
Enough of your borax, Poindexter!
A man's life is at stake! We need action!

261
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,922
Take that, you lousy dimension!

262
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,933
Huh? Huh?

263
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,635
Oh, there's so much
I don't know about astrophysics.

264
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,645
I wish I read that book
by that wheelchair guy.

265
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:59,396
I'll save Homer! All I needs
is four stout men to work the bellows.

266
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,398
No, Pops. It's too risky.

267
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,526
For all we know, there could be cubes in there
the size of gorillas and other large-

268
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,469
<i>Help.! I don't have much time.!</i>

269
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,473
That does it!
I'm going in!

270
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,270
Bart, no!

271
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,911
Cool, man!

272
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,882
I'm gonna be sucked into a black hole!
I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!

273
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,927
And what's gonna become of me
on the other side? I don't know!

274
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,394
I'll save you, Dad.

275
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,432
I can't get any closer.

276
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,503
You'll have to jump!

277
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,340
Piece of cake, son.

278
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,172
Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!
Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!

279
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,289
Bart, what happened?

280
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,087
Well, we hit a little snag when the universe
sort of collapsed on itself.

281
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,094
But Dad seemed cautiously optimistic.

282
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,393
<i>Cra-a-a-ap.!</i>

283
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,399
Homie.

284
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:13,301
Be strong, Marge.
I'm sure he's gone to a better place.

285
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,575
<i>D'oh.!</i>

286
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,273
Eew!
This is the worst place yet.

287
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,385
Oh, my god! Look at the-

288
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,028
Ooh! Erotic cakes.
