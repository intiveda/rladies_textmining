00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,477
D'oh!

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,843
Run, Daddy! Run!

4
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,938
Open the door, Maude!

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,950
I don't have time
for the secret knock!

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,282
<i>Oh.! I'm panicking, Neddy.!</i>

7
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,287
<i>I can't work the knob.</i>

<i>This is Kent Brockman with a special report
from the Channel 6 News copter.</i>

9
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,404
A large bearlike animal,
most likely a bear...

10
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:19,205
<i>has wandered down from the hills
in search of food or, perhaps, employment.</i>

11
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:23,043
<i>Please remain calm.
Stay in your homes.</i>

12
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,715
Looks like bad news for the...

13
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,691
<i>Impson family.</i>

14
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,921
Let's all calm down.

15
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,591
Everyone's gonna be just fine,
as long as I've got enough beers.

16
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,896
All right, that does it.

17
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,905
If I'm gonna be trapped
inside the house...

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,907
I gotta go out
and buy some beer.

19
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,241
Now, to drop gracefully
through the windshield.

20
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,692
I got ya, Dad!

21
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:06,090
I got ya, Dad!

22
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,603
Sweet dreams, Smokey.

23
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:22,334
Ow! Animal tranquilizer!

24
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,103
Oh!

25
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,212
Smooth!

26
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,348
Book 'em, Lou.
One count of being a bear.

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,361
And one count of
being an accessory to being a bear.

28
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,529
Oh, Marge,
it was horrible!

29
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,371
We were trapped in the house
all afternoon.

30
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:01,277
And, well, we had to
drink toilet water.

31
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,474
Well, things were bad everywhere.

32
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,416
I'm sick of these
constant bear attacks.

33
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,488
It's like a freakin'
Country BearJamboroo around here!

34
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,252
Well, now, realistically, Homer,
I've lived here some 30-odd years.

35
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,294
This is the first
and only bear I've ever seen.

36
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,921
Hey, if you want wild bears
eating your children...

37
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,466
and scaring away your salmon,
that's your business.

38
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,435
But I'm not gonna take it!
Who's with me?

39
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,562
I am! I am!

40
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,966
We're here! We're queer!

41
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,976
We don't want any more bears!

42
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,980
<i>We're here.! We're queer.!
We don't want any more bears.!</i>

43
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,983
Hey, Homer, that's a pretty catchy chant.
Where'd you learn it?

44
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,145
Oh, I heard it at the mustache parade
they have every year.

45
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,155
<i>We don't want any more bears.!</i>

46
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,782
- Sir, there's an unruly mob to see you.
- Does it have an appointment?

47
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,157
Uh, yes, it does.

48
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,162
I phoned ahead!

49
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,255
Mr. Mayor, I hate to
break it to you...

50
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,834
but your city
is infested with bears!

51
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,563
Yeah. And these ones are smarter
than the average bear.

52
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,571
They swiped
my "pic-a-nic" basket.

53
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,971
Think of the children!

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,536
Very well. I promise swift and decisive action
against these hibernating hucksters.

55
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,523
<i>Ah, not a bear in sight.</i>

56
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,690
The Bear Patrol
must be working like a charm.

57
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,791
- That's specious reasoning, Dad.
- Thank you, honey.

58
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,065
By your logic, I could claim
this rock keeps tigers away.

59
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,697
- Oh, how does it work?
- It doesn't work.

60
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,400
- Uh-huh.
- It's just a stupid rock.

61
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,479
- Uh-huh.
- But I don't see any tigers around here, do you?

62
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,313
Lisa, I want to buy your rock.

63
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,051
Whoo-hoo! A perfect day!

64
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,028
Zero bears and one big,
fat, hairy paycheck.

65
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,656
Hey! How come my pay is so low?

66
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,327
"Bear Patrol Tax $5.00."

67
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,098
What? This is an outrage!

68
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,605
It's the biggest
tax increase in history!

69
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,472
Actually, Dad, it's the smallest
tax increase in history.

70
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,205
Let the bears pay the bear tax.
I pay the Homer tax.

71
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,781
That's the homeowner tax.

72
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,941
Well, anyway, I'm still outraged.

73
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,852
<i>Down with taxes.! Down with taxes.!</i>

74
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,085
<i>Down with taxes.!</i>

75
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,685
Won't you think of the children?

76
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,923
Are these morons getting dumber,
or just louder?

77
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,329
Dumber, sir.
They won't give up the Bear Patrol...

78
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,734
but they won't pay
taxes for it either.

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,637
Ducking this issue
calls for real leadership.

80
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:47,109
People, your taxes are high
because of illegal immigrants.

81
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,738
That's right. Illegal immigrants.

82
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,749
We need to get rid of them!

83
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,912
"Immigants. " I knew it was them!

84
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,490
Even when it was the bears,
I knew it was them.

85
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:02,721
Oh! Won't somebody please
think of the children?

86
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,525
In one week, the town will vote
on a special referendum...

87
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,294
whether or not to deport
all illegal immigrants from Springfield.

88
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,604
It shall be known as Proposition 24. Yea!

89
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,298
It shall be known as Proposition 24. Yea!

90
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,846
Hey, German boy!
Go back to "Germania. "

91
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,976
I do not deserve this!

92
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,987
I've come here legally
as an exchange student.

93
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,684
Young man, the only thing
we exchange for you is our national dignity.

94
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,992
You want to pick on immigrants,
then pick on Willie!

95
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,557
Willie, please! The children
want to pick on someone their own size.

96
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,676
I don't see how you can support
Proposition 24, Dad.

97
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,772
Open your eyes, Lisa.

98
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,751
Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants,
kids like Bart have lost the will to learn.

99
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,753
There's no denying it, Sis.

100
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,653
But immigration is
what America's all about.

101
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,091
Even the Simpson family immigrated
to America. Right, Grandpa?

102
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,220
Okay, you twisted my arm.

103
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,164
The Simpson story begins
back in the old country.

104
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,498
<i>I forget which one exactly.</i>

105
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,733
<i>My father would drone
on and on about America.</i>

106
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,332
<i>He thought it was the greatest thing
since sliced bread...</i>

107
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,107
<i>sliced bread having been
invented the previous winter.</i>

108
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,206
See this, Son?
That's where we're going to live.

109
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,912
Maybe not today.
Maybe not tomorrow. But someday.

110
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,751
<i>Later that day, we set sail for America.</i>

111
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,759
There it is.
Our new home.

112
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,290
Whee! I love America!

113
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,830
Abe, supper's on!

114
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,122
We had to move out once
we'd filled the hat with garbage. The end.

115
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,538
Yeah, when those immigrants
get deported...

116
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,238
there'll be a lot more elbowroom
for regular joes like you and me, Apu.

117
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,315
Mr. Simpson...

118
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,385
it may astonish you to learn
that I am an immigrant.

119
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,182
You?
I don't believe it.

120
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,950
No. In truth,
an illegal immigrant, sir.

121
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,619
If Proposition 24 passes,
I shall be forced to leave this country.

122
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,856
Oh, I wish-

123
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,934
Oh, I wish I could have stayed
just one more year or two.

124
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:26,095
There was so much I wanted to see
and to do and to have done to me.

125
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:32,075
Oh, my God. I got so swept up in
the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24...

126
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:37,047
I never stopped to think it might
affect someone I cared about.

127
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,176
You know what, Apu?

128
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,381
I am really, really
gonna miss you.

129
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,466
You know what really "aggravateses" me
is them "immigants. "

130
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,043
They want all the benefits
of living in Springfield...

131
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,136
but they ain't even bothered to learn
themselves the language.

132
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,808
- Yeah. Those are exactly my "sentimonies. "
- Yeah!

133
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:16,480
Yeah, you said it, Barn.

134
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:28,462
Make the protesters go away,
and I'll give you the entire bottle.

135
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,662
Oh, thank you goodness.
My first customers in a week.

136
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,864
It's hard to believe someone
so close to our family...

137
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,873
could be an illegal alien.

138
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,875
Alas, it is true.

139
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,344
I came here shortly after
my graduation from Cal Tech...

140
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,415
<i>Calcutta Technical Institute.</i>

141
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,111
<i>As the top student
in my graduating class of seven million...</i>

142
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:51,781
<i>- I was accepted for graduate
study in the United States.</i>

143
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,621
Mmm.

144
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,599
Wherever you go and whatever you do,
we will always love you.

145
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,433
- Make us proud, Son.
- Never forget who you are.

146
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,667
I won't, Mother.
And I won't forget you, Manjula.

147
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,267
I'm so sorry our arranged marriage
will not come to pass.

148
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,279
Farewell, my beloved.

149
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,544
<i>I enrolled at
Springfield Heights Institute of Technology...</i>

150
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,610
<i>under the tutelage
of the brilliant professor, John Frink.</i>

151
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,681
Well, sure, the Frinkiac 7 looks impressive-
don't touch it-

152
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,126
but I predict that within 100 years,
computers will be twice as powerful...

153
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,255
10,000 times larger...

154
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,962
and so expensive that only the five
richest kings of Europe will own them.

155
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,129
Could it be used for dating?

156
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,173
Well, theoretically, yes.

157
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:47,177
But the computer matches would be so perfect
as to eliminate the thrill of romantic conquest.

158
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,377
Nine glorious years later,
I completed my Ph. D. thesis.

159
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,478
200,000 precisely ordered punch cards...

160
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,820
comprising the world's very first
tic-tac-toe program.

161
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,986
<i>- Only the top human players could beat it.
- Hey, what's this one for?</i>

162
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,122
Oh!

163
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,828
<i>So, Apu, why didn't you go back
to India when your student visa expired?</i>

164
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,929
I did not feel right leaving
without paying off my student loans.

165
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,532
- Mm-hmm.
- So I took a job at the Kwik-E-Mart.

166
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,170
When my debts were wiped clean,
I was all set to go.

167
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,477
But by then I had made
so many friends here.

168
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,552
What you're saying
is so understandable.

169
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,520
And, really, your only crime
was violating U.S. law.

170
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,091
Oh, you are
one of the good ones.

171
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,888
You know what?
I'm going to vote no on 24.

172
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,492
Mom, you're the greatest!

173
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,237
Could I have this licorice?

174
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:50,572
Uh, good evening, um, young man.
My name is Charles Norwood.

175
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:55,909
Furthermore, to this beer, I would also like
three of your finest, cheapest cigars.

176
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,075
Here's my I.D.
which confirms my "adultivity. "

177
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,716
Hmm.

178
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,020
Hey, Kearney, this fake I.D.,
it is truly excellent.

179
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,063
Say, if you tell me
where you obtained it...

180
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:16,191
I will overlook the ice cream sandwiches
concealed in your armpits, eh?

181
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,099
Deal.

182
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:28,245
Okay. Here are your fraudulent documents,
Mr. Nahasapeemapetilon.

183
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,747
Your U.S. passport,
social security card...

184
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,410
birth certificate,
and your death certificate.

185
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,716
Just hold onto that one
in your safe-deposit box.

186
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,347
Most humble and
grateful thanks to you.

187
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,358
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

188
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,860
Can the courtesy.
You're an American now.

189
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,955
Remember. You were born
in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

190
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,832
Your parents were Herb and
Judy Nahasapeemapetilon.

191
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:56,272
And if you do not wish to arouse suspicion,
I strongly urge you to act American.

192
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,002
<i>Hey there, Homer. How's it hanging?</i>

193
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,343
Low and lazy. So-

194
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,180
Hey. Say something again.

195
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,222
Oh, you're just noticing the way
I'm talking to you now.

196
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:15,692
You see, it turns out
I am an American citizen after all.

197
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,459
Apparently, I just plumb forgot about it.

198
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:25,697
Say, let's take a relaxed attitude
toward work and watch the baseball match.

199
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,707
The "Ny" Mets are
my favorite squadron.

200
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,505
Hey, you got rid of that
goofy sacred elephant statue.

201
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,308
Oh, yeah. What was
I thinking with that?

202
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,681
Who needs the infinite
compassion of Ganesha...

203
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:45,052
when I've got Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman staring at me...

204
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,887
<i>from Entertainment Weekly
with their dead eyes?</i>

205
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,690
Look at me! I've betrayed
my Indian heritage, sir!

206
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,197
What would my parents
think of me now?

207
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,064
Make us proud, Son.
- Never forget who you are.

208
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,869
Don't make the same mistake I did.

209
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,444
Oh, forgive me, Mother.

210
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:10,743
Father, I've failed you.

211
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,718
Who am I kidding?
I am no citizen.

212
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,555
This passport is a cheap forgery!

213
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,324
A cheap, $2,000 forgery.

214
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,095
I have brought shame to my parents,
to my homeland and to myself.

215
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,295
Don't forget Ganesha.

216
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,739
I cannot deny my roots,
and I cannot keep up this charade.

217
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,676
I only did it because I love this land...

218
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,011
where I have the freedom to say
and to think and to charge whatever I want.

219
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,779
I want to stay, but as the real me...

220
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,412
not as some yahoo from Green Bay.

221
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,422
Oh.

222
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,518
Wow.

223
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,090
You must love this country more than I love
a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning.

224
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:06,137
Darn it, Apu! I'm not
gonna let them kick you out!

225
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,366
I never should've bought this button!

226
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,467
- Can I have my three dollars back?
- Store credit only.

227
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,842
<i>Hey, Marge.!
Look who I brought home.!</i>

228
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,152
Oh, Homer. Are you
rounding up immigrants?

229
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,380
No, Marge.

230
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,720
Apu convinced me that
Proposition 24 is a big mistake.

231
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,158
All right! Now you've got
all the Simpsons behind you, Apu.

232
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,720
That's nice, although three of you
are below voting age.

233
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,459
And I'm not registered.

234
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,934
I do appreciate your concern, really.
But it is hopeless.

235
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,600
The latest poll shows a whooping
85% support for Proposition 24.

236
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,701
<i>Hey, Apu, why don't you just
marry some American broad...</i>

237
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,076
then dump her after
you get your citizenship?

238
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,215
Hello, Selma?

239
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,219
Selma, my dear. How are ya?

240
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,812
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

241
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,823
Listen, shut up for a second.

242
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,291
How would you like to marry Apu
so he doesn't get deported?

243
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:07,195
I'd rather eat poison. My name's already
Selma Bouvier Terwilliger Hutz McClure.

244
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,632
God knows it's long enough
without Nahassapetapeeta-whatever.

245
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:15,901
From now on, I'm only marrying for love.
Possibly once more for money.

246
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,580
Oh, it's hopeless.
Oh, poor Apu.

247
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,548
Hey! The government
don't control the sky.

248
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,518
<i>- What if you lived in a balloon?
- That's it.!</i>

249
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,588
Did you hear that, Mom?
She's as dumb as me.

250
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,886
No! Not what he said,
what he is.

251
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,451
Grandfather,
as in grandfather clause.

252
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,431
- Apu, how long ago did your visa expire?
- Seven years. But I don't-

253
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,900
There was an amnesty declared
for people who have been here as long as you.

254
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,302
That means you can take
the citizenship test!

255
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:52,070
- Oh!
- But, Apu, the vote on Proposition 24 is on Tuesday.

256
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,236
You'll have to pass
the test before then.

257
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,180
Oh, no. That is not nearly enough time to
learn over 200 years of American history.

258
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,774
<i>Oh, it can't be that many.</i>

259
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,514
<i>Come on, Apu.
I'll be your tutor.</i>

260
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,422
Please identify this object.

261
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,260
It appears to be the flag which disappeared
from the public library last year.

262
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,598
Correct. Now, we all know
the 13 stripes are for good luck.

263
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,107
But why does the American flag
have precisely 47 stars?

264
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,439
Because this particular flag
is ridiculously out-of-date.

265
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,208
The library must have purchased it
during the brief period in 1912...

266
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,284
after New Mexico became a state,
but before Arizona did.

267
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,216
Uh, partial credit.

268
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:41,081
Now, they may ask you to locate your town
on a map of the U.S. So, let's do that.

269
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,959
Uh, Springfield, Springfield.
Right here.

270
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,592
<i>Dad, you're not pointing anywhere
near Springfield. It's over here, Apu.</i>

271
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,601
Hey! What you doin'? Studyin'?

272
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,730
Oh, I'm so confused. I don't even know
where I'm getting kicked out of anymore.

273
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,114
Whoa!

274
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,250
Sign's floating away, Chief.

275
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:11,220
Executive, legislative and, uh, judicial.

276
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,951
No, no and no.

277
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,119
Maybe we should start all over
with the electrical college.

278
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,424
Please, Mr. Simpson.
My brain needs sleep.

279
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,431
The test is in six hours.

280
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,001
And many of these facts you speak of
are completely new to me.

281
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,663
Sleep is for the weak, Apu!
Now, I'm gonna go to bed...

282
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,605
while you look over my notes
from ninth-grade history.

283
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,371
Okay, Apu. Stay awake
and stay focused.

284
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,642
Cotton Mather-

285
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,181
Oh, no! I fell asleep!

286
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,223
I have forgotten everything
that Mr. Homer taught me!

287
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,816
Perfect. Let's roll.

288
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,027
Immigrant go home!
Immigrant go home!

289
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,193
- Get outta here!
- Gosh, you're annoying.

290
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,072
Hmm. Hmph.

291
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,609
Hmm.

292
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,511
All right, men.
Here's the order of deportations.

293
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,748
First you'll be rounding up
your tired, then your poor...

294
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,688
then your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.

295
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,258
Breathers. Got it.

296
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,123
All right,
here's your last question.

297
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,423
What was the cause
of the Civil War?

298
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,658
Actually,
there were numerous causes.

299
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,759
Aside from the obvious schism between
abolitionists and anti-abolitionists...

300
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,532
economic factors,
both domestic and international-

301
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,607
- Hey, hey!
- Yeah?

302
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,471
- Just say slavery.
- Slavery it is, sir.

303
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,273
Yes! I am a citizen!

304
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,474
Now, which way
to the welfare office?

305
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,019
- What?
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I work. I work.

306
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,256
<i>Thank you.
I want to say thank you to everyone.</i>

307
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,157
From this day forth, I am no longer
an Indian living in America.

308
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,593
I am an Indian American.

309
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,165
Yeah!

310
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,326
You know, Apu, in a way,
all Americans are immigrants.

311
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,336
Except Native Americans.

312
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,338
Yeah. Native Americans
like us.

313
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,340
- No. I mean American Indians.
- Like me.

314
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,909
No. I mean-

315
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,070
Hi, everyone. If I could
just say a few words...

316
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,080
I'd be a better public speaker.

317
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,483
Now that you're all relaxed-

318
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,488
Most of us here
were born in America.

319
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,854
We take this country
for granted.

320
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,859
But not immigrants like Apu.

321
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,361
While the rest of us are
drinking ourselves stupid...

322
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,455
they're driving the cabs
that get us home safely...

323
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,364
they're writing the operas
that entertain us every day...

324
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,563
they're training our tigers
and kicking our extra points.

325
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:46,110
These people are the glue that
holds together the gears of our society.

326
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:51,308
If we pass Proposition 24, we'll be losing
some of the truest Americans of all.

327
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,352
When you go to the polls tomorrow...

328
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,356
please vote no on Proposition 24.

329
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,154
No on 24.

330
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,729
No on 24.

331
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,458
No on 24.
