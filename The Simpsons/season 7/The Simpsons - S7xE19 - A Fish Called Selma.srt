00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,270
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,478
D'oh!

3
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,590
Movie For
A Rained-Out Ballgame now returns...

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,165
to Dyan Cannon, Troy McClure
and the Muppets...

5
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,166
in the 1977 film...

6
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,429
<i>The Muppets Go Medieval.</i>

7
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,473
Oh, Princess fair, whilst thou grant me
thine dainty hoof in marriage?

8
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,771
Oh, Sir Liesalot, I will!

9
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,778
Mmm.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,212
<i>Unhand the swine, you swain.</i>

11
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,579
Come, Piggy. Back to Hamelot.

12
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,847
Not now, frog. Me and Iron-Pants
are just getting acquainted.

13
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,659
Dad, what's a "Muppet?"

14
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,561
Well, it's not quite a mop
and it's not quite a puppet, but, man-

15
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,499
So, to answer your question, I don't know.

16
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,002
<i>- Parry.
- Why'd they make that one Muppet out ofleather?</i>

17
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,699
That's not a leather Muppet.
That's Troy McClure.

18
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,403
Oh, back in the '70s,
he was quite the teen heartthrob.

19
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,275
Yeah. Who'd have thought
he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?

20
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,249
- What are you talking about?
- You know, his bizarre personal life.

21
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,718
Those weird things they say he does
down at the aquarium. Why, I heard-

22
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,086
Oh, Homer!
That's just an urban legend.

23
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,625
People don't do
that type of thing with fish.

24
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:38,254
Troy McClure's a perfect gentleman,
like Bing Crosby orJ.F.K.

25
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,992
I wonder where Troy is now.

26
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,736
<i>Uh-oh. Oh. Oh.</i>

27
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,105
<i>Hey, these guys
are all over the road.!</i>

28
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,715
All right, Captain Rush-Rush.
Out of the car.

29
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,583
Oh, I'm seeing stars here!

30
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,658
No, just one.
Hi. I'm Troy McClure.

31
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,057
<i>You may remember me from such films
as The Greatest Story Ever Hulaed...</i>

32
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,323
<i>and They Came to Burgle Carnegie Hall.</i>

33
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,590
Uh, afraid not. License, please.

34
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:20,738
It says here you need corrective lenses.
Put those glasses on, mister.

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,809
You wouldn't ask a handsome man
like me to wear glasses!

36
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,936
It'd be a crime against nature!

37
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:32,643
Well, they do kind of
make you look like a nerd.

38
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,880
Tell you what. Just go down to the D.M.V.
tomorrow and try to pass that eye test.

39
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,050
I'll tear up this ticket, but I'm still
gonna have to ask you for a bribe.

40
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,497
Hello, Marge. Hello, Marge.

41
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,033
How come no Chippendales dancers...

42
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,296
ever come in to renew their licenses?

43
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,703
They carpool.
That's the problem.

44
00:02:56,142 --> 00:03:00,602
Hey, I came here to get this revoked!

45
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:04,774
Troy McClure? I thought he disappeared
after that scandal at the aquarium.

46
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,512
Hey, I thought you said
Troy McClure was dead!

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,317
No. What I said was
he sleeps with the fishes. You see-

48
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,224
Uh, Tony, please! No.
I just ate a whole plate of"dingamagoo. "

49
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,855
Oh! Troy McClure!

50
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,299
Hello, beautiful.

51
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,308
John Law tells me I might need
to wear these glasses.

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,675
You?
Nonsense. You're Troy McClure.

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,409
<i>I remember you from such films
as MeetJoe Blow...</i>

54
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,179
<i>and Give My Remains to Broadway.</i>

55
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,084
Stars like you don't need glasses.

56
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,056
Yuck!

57
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,923
Now, Mr. McClure, would you like
to take off those glasses...

58
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,928
and read the top line?

59
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,023
Uh, W...

60
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,763
<i>seven, star, pound.</i>

61
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,637
Look, Miss... "Boo-Veer. "

62
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,041
As an actor,
I depend on my remarkable looks.

63
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,208
If you could find it
in your heart to pass me...

64
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,911
I'm sure I could find some way to repay you.

65
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,147
Say by buying you dinner?

66
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,156
That took a lot of class.

67
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,827
All these celebrities on the walls.

68
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,427
<i>I just know a big star like you
is up there somewhere.</i>

69
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,336
Uh, yes. I'm over there.

70
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,909
<i>Hmm? Hmm.</i>

71
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,377
<i>Hmm. Mm-mmm. Hmm.</i>

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,778
<i>Hmm. Oh.!</i>

73
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,818
So, working at the D.M.V.
must be very interesting.

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,321
Well, I think I'm getting
Repetitive Stress Disorder...

75
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,154
from scratching my butt all day.

76
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,560
Being a huge movie star must be good too.

77
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,633
What are you working on now?

78
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,997
I've been reading a lot of scripts lately.

79
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,798
You know, it's a lot cheaper
than going to the movies.

80
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,769
Well, thanks for holding up
your end of the bargain.

81
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,847
I had a pretty good time.

82
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,438
Yeah. Me too.
You need a ride somewhere?

83
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,519
Hey, get a load of this!
Troy McClure on what looks like a date!

84
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,915
Here you go, boys.
A little something for page one.

85
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:35,060
<i>Hey, Homer.! Isn't this your sister-in-law
on a date with Troy McClure?</i>

86
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,796
Troy McClure.
He's a washed-up movie star.

87
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,236
He could be dating
washed-up supermodels.

88
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,535
Oh, I don't know.

89
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,873
Maybe those rumors about his fish fetish
weren't true after all.

90
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,640
This changes everything.
I'd pay to see him in a movie now.

91
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,943
If only that were possible.

92
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,980
<i>Troy! My man! It's MacArthur Parker!</i>

93
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,991
MacArthur Parker, the agent?

94
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,993
<i>MacArthur Parker, my agent?</i>

95
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,553
<i>Just checking in, my friend.
So, how's my favorite client?</i>

96
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,691
- We haven't spoken in eight years.
- Yes.

97
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,702
So, I saw the papers today, Troy.
Looking good.

98
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,001
That wholesome stuff really helps
when I'm trying to find you work.

99
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,372
You haven't found me work in 12 years.

100
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,672
Oh, you! Jury duty is work.

101
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,044
And, listen, you keep getting seen
in public with human females...

102
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,947
and I can get you work
in the entertainment industry.

103
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,447
<i>Hey.!</i>

104
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,985
Hello. Selma Bouvier?
It's Troy McClure.

105
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,622
You may remember me
from such dates as last night's dinner.

106
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,102
- Hey! Troy! Troy!
- That's right, boys.

107
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,536
Troy's back from the gutter,
and he's brought someone with him!

108
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,541
That's too funny!

109
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,373
I can't remember
when I've heard a funnier anecdote!

110
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,379
Okay, now you tell one.

111
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,177
Well, not much happens to me...

112
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,014
but I once had dinner
with a movie star...

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,556
and it was the most
wonderful night of my life.

114
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,182
Really? Who was it? George Segal?

115
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:11,252
I hear he plays the banjo.

116
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,800
Hmm, yeah.

117
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,764
Excuse me.
I ordered a Zima, not "emphysema. "

118
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,169
Please, don't smoke in our restaurant.

119
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,801
We don't serve contemporary
California cuisine in your lungs.

120
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:31,711
Troy, uh,
I'm sorry I ruined our evening.

121
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,378
I have to go now. Oh, my God!

122
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,957
Oh, God! I'm such a fool.

123
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,586
<i>Got a light?</i>

124
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,904
Oh.

125
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,400
Sounds like you're really falling for him.

126
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,173
What's the matter?
I'm not fun enough for you?

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,475
Patty!
Go on, Selma. Tell me more.

128
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,552
I don't want to jinx it, Marge,
but this could be it.

129
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,620
He asked me out again this Friday.

130
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,349
He's taking me to a special screening
of his latest film.

131
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,930
You know, smoke actually smells good
when it's coming outta you.

132
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,266
- Oh, I'm all out.
- Here. Try one of my cigars.

133
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,770
Mmm.

134
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,810
My God!
It's like five cigarettes at once!

135
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,512
Oh, my head is swimming!

136
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,022
That's not cigars, baby.
That's love.

137
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,958
No longer canst I conceal my love,
my wimpled turtledove.

138
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:55,124
Oh, Princess fair, whilst thou grant me
thine dainty hoof in marriage?

139
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,429
<i>- Oh, Troy!
- Oh, Sir Liesalot.!</i>

140
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,732
I will!

141
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,410
- Ohh!
- Just a second, baby.

142
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:16,320
Tonight, '70s leading man Troy McClure
has finally met the woman of his dreams.

143
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,755
We may remember-
Woman? Huh. Okay.

144
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,986
We may remember Troy
from such films...

145
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,120
<i>as The Verdict Was Mail Fraud
and Leper in the Backfield.</i>

146
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,428
With his high-profile romance...

147
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,870
Troy's managed to shake the rumors
that have dogged his career.

148
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:40,037
And with news of his upcoming wedding,
rumor has it he's up for some very choice roles.

149
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,979
Looks like you were wrong when you
called him a washed-up deviant, Laurie.

150
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,982
All right.

151
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,416
Make sure my iguana's okay.

152
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,554
Selma, JubJub is fantastic!

153
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,785
He's everywhere you want to be.

154
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,261
Welcome to your new home, baby.
It's fantastic!

155
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,267
Garbage collection is Monday. If you want
to throw out a box, you have to cut it up.

156
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,339
It's so modern.

157
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,568
It's ultramodern, like living
in the not-too-distant future.

158
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,644
Now, you make yourself
at home here.

159
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,441
I'll be sleeping downstairs
in the visitor's center.

160
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:19,712
- Oh. Okay.
- I'll see you in the morning, and get ready for tennis.

161
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,811
It comes on at 10:00.

162
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,557
<i>Troy, Mac Parker.
Ever hear of Planet of the Apes?</i>

163
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,856
Uh, the movie or the planet?

164
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,126
The brand-new,
multi-million-dollar musical!

165
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,896
And you are starring...
as the human.

166
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,472
It's the part
I was born to play, baby!

167
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,910
Help.
The human's about to escape.

168
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,680
Get your paws off me, you dirty ape!

169
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,721
He can talk!

170
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,019
He can talk. He can talk.
He can talk! He can talk!

171
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:04,028
<i>- He can talk.! He can talk.!
- I can sing</i>

172
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,997
<i>Ooh! Help me, Dr. Zaius!</i>

173
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,999
Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius

174
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,731
Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius

175
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,831
Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius
Oh, Dr. Zaius

176
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,842
Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius

177
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,504
- What's wrong with me
- I think you're crazy

178
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,174
- Want a second opinion
- You're also lazy

179
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,478
Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius

180
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,577
Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius

181
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,524
- Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius, oh, Dr. Zaius
- Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius

182
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,925
Can I play the piano anymore

183
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,793
- Of course you can
- Well, I couldn't before

184
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,100
<i>- Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius
- This play has everything.</i>

185
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,606
Oh, I love legitimate theater.

186
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,677
<i>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius</i>

187
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,543
I hate every ape I see

188
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,345
From chimpan-A to chimpan-Z

189
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,979
No, you'll never make a monkey

190
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,150
Out of me

191
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,786
Oh, my God, I was wrong

192
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,457
It was Earth all along

193
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,094
You finally made a monkey

194
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,196
Yes, we finally made a monkey

195
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,935
Yes, you finally

196
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,706
Made a monkey

197
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:35,743
Out of me

198
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,153
I love you, Dr. Zaius.

199
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,362
Thank you.
It's great to be back.

200
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:50,526
I just want to say I wouldn't be here
without the support of a very special lady-

201
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,230
my always outrageous fiancée, Selma.

202
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,172
- Take a bow, sugar beet.
- Oh. Well. Thank you.

203
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,766
<i>Down in front!</i>

204
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,548
My good looks paid for that pool...

205
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,640
and my talent filled it with water.

206
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,049
Hi, I'm Troy McClure,
your future uncle.

207
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,622
Hi. I remember you
from such filmstrips...

208
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,988
<i>as Locker Room Towel Fight:
The Blinding of Larry Driscoll.</i>

209
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,223
- I was one of the first to speak
out against horseplay. - Uh-huh.

210
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,029
Remember when we were kids,
we used to dream about our ideal husbands?

211
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,569
Who knew the dream
would come true for one of us?

212
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,468
Oh, come on! Guess which one.

213
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,644
I know. I know. It's Selma, right?

214
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,044
<i>Yeah, that's a good idea, Homer...</i>

215
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,945
<i>but they've already made
some movies about World War II.</i>

216
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,280
Aw, hell!
Well, what about Dracula?

217
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,058
Homer, I'm really touched
you invited me out on the town.

218
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,219
You're gonna be
a four-star brother-in-law.

219
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,923
Troy, buddy, I got to know.

220
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,832
What's a great guy like you
want to marry a guy like Selma?

221
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,836
- Come here, Homer.
- Okay.

222
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,463
I'll let you in on a little secret.

223
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,650
And do you, Selma Bouvier
Terwilliger Bouvier...

224
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,084
take the fabulous Troy McClure
to be your lawful wedded husband?

225
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,088
I already told you yes.

226
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,490
If anyone here knows why this couple
should not be wed in holy matrimony...

227
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:26,725
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

228
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,401
Da-da da-da-da Hey!

229
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,999
Da-da-da-da, da-da da-da-da
Hey! Da-da

230
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,908
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

231
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,380
You may now kiss... each other.

232
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,884
This is the best day of my life.

233
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,119
It's a good day for me too, baby.

234
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,186
Now, smile. We're gonna be
on every newsstand in the country.

235
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,525
Mwah!

236
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,435
Hey! Look what I snagged, Marge.

237
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,770
The candy bride and groom
from the wedding cake.

238
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,210
Mmm. Pointy.

239
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,881
It was a beautiful wedding.
I've never seen Selma happier.

240
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,959
That reminds me-Troy said something
interesting last night at the bar.

241
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,358
Apparently,
he doesn't really love Selma...

242
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,930
and the marriage is just a sham
to help his career.

243
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,159
Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle.

244
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,168
What? Oh, my God!

245
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,306
<i>Marge, could you close your eyes?</i>

246
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,535
<i>I'm trying to sleep.</i>

247
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,544
<i>There.</i>

248
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,321
This better be important.
It's my wedding night. I'm trying to sleep.

249
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:00,722
Sleep is for has-beens, my friend, and you're
about to have a very crowded schedule.

250
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,886
- This marriage scam is paying off big-time.
- Phone for you.

251
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,796
- T. McC.!
- Troy, darling, come to bed.

252
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,994
I want to see the Troy McClure
I remember from such films...

253
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:15,199
<i>as Make-Out King of Montana
and The Electric Gigolo.</i>

254
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,869
Yeah. In a minute, darling.

255
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,506
Well, she may be helping my career,
but she's starting to cramp my style.

256
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,083
Oh, who cares?
The offers are rolling in.

257
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,552
Paramount wants you for a buddy comedy
with Rob Lowe and Hugh Grant.

258
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,749
- Those sick freaks?
- Okay. Then get this.

259
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,021
I think they want you to play
McBain's sidekick in- brace yourself-

260
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,390
the new McBain movie!

261
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,794
McBain's sidekick? Hot damn!

262
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,798
I'm going to Sea World!

263
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,201
Selma, about you and Troy-

264
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,935
We're not sure he's all he seems.

265
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,011
Marge is right.
He's wrong for you.

266
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,603
Better you find out sooner than later.

267
00:16:55,714 --> 00:17:00,651
Wrong for me? How?
Oh, I get it.

268
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,519
My sisters have come down with
a case of the green-eyed gazungas.

269
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,614
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

270
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,388
You're stuck in a menial job
you'll be doing 10 years after you die.

271
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,364
And you're tied down to a man
who'd have to bathe to be a slob.

272
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,764
Selma, Troy doesn't love you at all.

273
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,134
He's only using you to squelch the rumors
about his bizarre personal life...

274
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,207
and further his career.

275
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,436
You don't know
what you're talking about...

276
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,013
and I have to go now and see Troy.

277
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,691
Is this a sham marriage?

278
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,818
Sure, baby.
Is that a problemo?

279
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,227
You married me
just to help your career?

280
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,299
You make it sound so sordid.

281
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,868
- Look, don't we have a good time together?
- Yes, but-

282
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,960
Don't you have everything
you ever wanted here?

283
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,132
Money, security,
a big, hot, flat rock forJubJub?

284
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,835
But... don't you love me?

285
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:03,745
Sure, I do, like I love Fresca.
Isn't that enough?

286
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:08,684
The only difference between our marriage
and anyone else's is we know ours is a sham.

287
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,780
- Are you gay?
- Gay? I wish!

288
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,950
If I were gay,
there'd be no problem.

289
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,029
No, what I have is
a romantic abnormality...

290
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,362
one so unbelievable that it must
be hidden from the public at all costs.

291
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,368
- You see-
- Stop!

292
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,098
You're asking me to live a lie.

293
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:31,006
- I don't know if I can do that.
- It's remarkably easy.

294
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,444
Just smile for the cameras
and enjoy Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.

295
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,015
You'll go to the right parties,
meet the right people.

296
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,085
Sure, you'll be a sham wife...

297
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,018
but you'll be the envy
of every other sham wife in town.

298
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,590
So, what do you say, baby?

299
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,327
Tell me again
about Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.

300
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,629
One day, my lady Selma's
gonna have a star right next to mine...

301
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,904
so watch out, Laszlo Panaflex.

302
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,542
Tonight all Hollywood's wondering
who'll be chosen to costar...

303
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,517
<i>in the big, new McBain pic,
McBain IV: Fatal Discharge.</i>

304
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,083
- Oh! You watching?
- Mac, you gotta get me that part.

305
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,159
I will, but you gotta
do something for me.

306
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,058
The problem is, the big parts these days
are all going to family men.

307
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,131
But I already got married!

308
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:30,793
Yeah, but for a role like this, you gotta pour
it on-you and wife have gotta have a baby.

309
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,566
- A baby, eh? What do I do?
- I'll send you over a pamphlet.

310
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,006
You can't buy that kind of P.R., but you
can get it for nothing by having a baby...

311
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,476
which, by the way, your insurance
will cover except for the deductible...

312
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,547
which I'll reimburse you for
if you get the part...

313
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,616
which you will if you have a baby.

314
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,880
<i>- C'est Troy bien.
- Okay. Now, listen. Let's talk baby names.</i>

315
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:53,117
You can't use Montana,
Dakota or Florida- they're taken.

316
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,922
- Mmm. Oregon?
- Oh! Pacific Northwest. Very hot.

317
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,592
Having a child- that's a big step.

318
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,168
You bet it is!
Think what it'll mean!

319
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,535
Not just the McBain movie, but maybe
my own fragrance- "Smellin' ofTroy"!

320
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,701
It is probably my last chance to be a mommy.

321
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,779
Cigarette, Mrs. McClure?

322
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,213
You bet!
From now on, she's smoking for two!

323
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,788
Uh, come here, tiger.

324
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,954
Hmm. Would you like some wine?

325
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,657
Yes!

326
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,832
Uh, why don't you come over here...

327
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,307
and make yourself more comfortable?

328
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,040
<i>No. Why don't you come over here
and make yourself comfortable?</i>

329
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,582
I'm sorry.
This whole concept's foreign to me.

330
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,244
Who knew a baby
would be so much work?

331
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,085
Having a baby
isn't supposed to be work.

332
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,659
It's supposed to be
an expression of the feelings...

333
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,990
we're supposed to have for each other.

334
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,896
Oh. Like how we built that snowman
together in that Newport ad?

335
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,730
Remember how "alive with pleasure"
they said we were?

336
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,003
Look, I'm sorry.
A loveless marriage is one thing.

337
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,082
We're not hurting anybody.

338
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,151
But bringing a child
into a loveless family...

339
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,220
is something I just can't do.

340
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,221
Oh, great! We'll adopt.

341
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,486
I'll call my agent. He'll find some kid
who wants in on the deal.

342
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,561
Good-bye, Troy.

343
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,928
I'll always remember you,
but not from your films.

344
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,075
Come on, JubJub.

345
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,771
Let's go home, and I'll
microwave you some nice roaches.

346
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,382
In a bold move that has stunned
Hollywood insiders...

347
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,788
newly divorced comeback kid Troy McClure...

348
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,589
<i>has turned down the supporting lead
in McBain IV...</i>

349
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,164
to direct and star in his own pet project...

350
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:17,258
The Contrabulous Fabtraption
of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.

351
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,269
Will the gambit pay off?

352
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,067
20th Century Fox is betting... it will.

353
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,329
Shh!
