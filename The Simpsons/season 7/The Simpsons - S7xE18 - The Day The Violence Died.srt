00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,477
D'oh!

00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:31,059
<i>We now return to our 48-hour
Itchy & Scratchy diamond jubilee marathon-</i>

4
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,156
celebrating 75 years
of rib-tickling brutality...

5
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,633
<i>and hilarious atrocities.</i>

6
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,569
The Itchy & Scratchy Show

7
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,779
Aw.

8
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,314
- If I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me.
- Will do.

9
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,981
Tonight: A stowaway bear
is terrorizing space shuttle astronauts.

10
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,050
But first a sneak peak
at tomorrow's Itchy and Scratchy parade.

11
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,152
Hello, everybody.
I'm here live on Main Street...

12
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,063
where dedicated fans are already staking out
the best seats for the big anniversary parade.

13
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,761
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

14
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,033
<i>Bye, kids. On your way back
pick up a six-pack ofbeer.</i>

15
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,167
Bart, Lisa, it's 11:00 at night.
Where do you think you're going?

16
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,371
- Downtown.
- We gotta get seats for the Itchy and Scratchy parade.

17
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:59,009
I won't have my children sitting alone
on a cold, dangerous street all night.

18
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,283
- Homer, you go too.
- Oh! Why can't they just take the gun?

19
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,463
Hey, the comic book store's still open.

20
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,124
- Save our seats.
- Will do.

21
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,792
- Hello.
- Oh!

22
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,506
Hey, sister, just give me a chance
to get next to you.

23
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,421
Hey-y-y!

24
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,957
Hey, my threads, baby.

25
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,755
<i>How come I've never seen
that Itchy & Scratchy before?</i>

26
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,330
Perhaps because you are
a prepubescent ignoramus.

27
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,730
<i>This is a bootleg copy
of Itchy & Scratchy Meet Fritz the Cat.</i>

28
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,668
Because of its frank depiction
of sex and narcotic consumption...

29
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,898
it is not for infantile intellects
such as yours.

30
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,202
Now toodle-oo.

31
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,777
Cool.
I'll give you 10 bucks for that.

32
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,943
<i>Are you the creator of Hi and Lois?
Because you are making me laugh.</i>

33
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,022
That drawing is worth
exactly $750 American.

34
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,217
- It's valuable, huh?
- Ooh, your powers of deduction are exceptional.

35
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,226
I simply can't allow you
to waste them here...

36
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,126
when there are so many crimes
going unsolved at this very moment.

37
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,223
- Go! Go, for the good of the city.
- Loser.

38
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,798
<i>Oh, nerts!</i>

39
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,145
- Which one's Itchy- the car?
- The mouse.

40
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,804
Oh. I guess that's not him then.

41
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,577
Represented on this next float
is Roger Myers Sr...

42
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,415
who founded his company in 1921...

43
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:46,652
and struck it big when he teamed up a mouse
named Itchy with a cat named Scratchy.

44
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,855
<i>Here we see him creating
the two comical characters...</i>

45
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,955
<i>out of thoughts
he plucks from his head.</i>

46
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,160
<i>And that man waving
from the front of the float...</i>

47
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,136
is his son, Roger Myers Jr.

48
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,470
Oh, isn't this just the most fun
you've ever had in your life, Dave?

49
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,543
Yes, Suzanne. It is.

50
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,611
Whoa! Whoa!

51
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,415
Oh, forget this.
I'm outta here.

52
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,592
<i>Yea, Bart.! Yea.!</i>

53
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,128
<i>And now the parade has entered Bumtown.!</i>

54
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,664
<i>Oh, it's all just so exciting, Dave.!</i>

55
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,293
<i>- Certainly seems to be
a poorly planned parade route.</i>

56
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,237
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

57
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,578
Hey, wait up!

58
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,673
Get outta Bumtown,
ya no-talent bum!

59
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,186
Show some respect, man.
That "no-talent" created Itchy and Scratchy.

60
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,655
He didn't create Itchy. I did.

61
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,888
- Huh?
- He stole the character from me in 1928.

62
00:04:55,995 --> 00:05:00,125
When I complained, his thugs kicked me out
of his office and dropped an anvil on me.

63
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,793
Luckily I was carrying an umbrella
at the time.

64
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:06,531
<i>You invented Itchy-
the Itchy & Scratchy Itchy?</i>

65
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,372
Sure. In fact, I invented the whole concept
of cartoon violence.

66
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:16,380
Before I came along, all cartoon animals did
was play the ukulele. I changed all that.

67
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,974
Well, I'm not callin' you a liar, but-

68
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,486
but I can't think of a way
to finish that sentence.

69
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,022
So I'm a liar, am I?

70
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,989
<i>"Itchy the Lucky Mouse
in Manhattan Madness. "</i>

71
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:35,830
That's the first Itchy cartoon ever made.
And it was made by me, ChesterJ. Lampwick.

72
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,301
Find me a 90-year-old projector
and I'll prove it to you.

73
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:02,260
<i>"Itchy runs afoul of an Irishman. "</i>

74
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,195
<i>Look out, Itchy.! He's Irish.!</i>

75
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,397
<i>Come on, Itchy. Kill him.! Kill that guy.!</i>

76
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,738
<i>"A chance for more mis"-</i>

77
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,108
<i>Look at that fat oaf.</i>

78
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,807
<i>Shh.! That's Teddy Roosevelt.</i>

79
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,523
<i>All right, Chester.! Woo.!</i>

80
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,500
<i>Way to go.!</i>

81
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,232
I can't believe it. That was Itchy all right.
You did invent him.

82
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,605
When people see this, you'll be rich and famous.

83
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,004
D'oh.

84
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:04,014
That was a nice film I had once.
Last time I try to impress a four-year-old.

85
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,751
Well, see ya, kid.

86
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,989
You can't just go back to the gutter.
You created Itchy. You should be a millionaire.

87
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,998
Ah, Roger Myers wouldn't
give me a cent in the '20s.

88
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,000
Why would he give me anything now?

89
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:21,062
<i>You asked Roger Myers Sr. for money.
Roger Myers Jr. 's in charge of the studio now.</i>

90
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,904
He's a good man.
Every Christmas he goes down to the pound...

91
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,036
and rescues one cat and one mouse
and gives them to a hungry family.

92
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:32,209
Hmm, studio's closed until Tuesday.
Animators have A.A. on Monday.

93
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,980
Hmm. Well, you can stay
at my house until then.

94
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,681
My parents won't mind
because they won't even know about it.

95
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,190
All right.
The coast is clear.

96
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,295
- There's a box you can sleep in.
- Thanks.

97
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,365
- Just move that cot outta the way.
- Okay.

98
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,366
- Do you know what radon is?
- No.

99
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,833
Good night.

100
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,702
<i>Spare change?</i>

101
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,643
Mom, there's a weird smell
and a lot of cursing...

102
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,939
coming from the basement,
and Dad's upstairs.

103
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,348
<i>Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.</i>

104
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,153
He's not a regular bum, Mom.
He's a genius bum.

105
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,320
He created Itchy,
and he's the father of cartoon violence.

106
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,694
He just needs to stay here till tomorrow.

107
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,367
We're goin' down to Itchy & Scratchy Studios
to pick up his check.

108
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:21,696
We're goin' down to Itchy & Scratchy Studios
to pick up his check.

109
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,441
Well, if it's just for one more night.

110
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,478
<i>So, let's review:</i>

111
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,311
You two screwballs have just strolled in here
fresh from the sewer...

112
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:43,150
and given me a bunch of bulldink
about creating Itchy-with no proof at all-

113
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,419
and you expect me to give you...
how much?

114
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,360
$800 billion.

115
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,199
Well, that brought back
a lot of memories.

116
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,574
All right, gentlemen,
I'll take your case.

117
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,473
But I'm going to have to ask for
a thousand-dollar retainer.

118
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,570
A thousand dollars?
But your ad says, "No money down. "

119
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,186
Oh, they got this all screwed up.

120
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,956
So you don't work
on a contingency basis?

121
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,494
No, money down!
Oops.

122
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,827
I shouldn't have
this Bar Association logo here either.

123
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,140
- Hey, Dad, can I have a thousand dollars?
- All right. Wait. For what?

124
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,837
- To pay for a lawyer for my bum.
- Forget it.

125
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,945
I thought I recognized you.

126
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:54,357
I gave you a plate of corn muffins
back in 1947 to paint my chicken coop.

127
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,657
- And you never did it!
- Those corn muffins were lousy.

128
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,856
- Paint my chicken coop!
- Make me!

129
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,701
- That does it. One of them has to go.
- Okay. Grandpa.

130
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,673
- No, the B-U-M.
- Oh.

131
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,539
<i>Wait. There's an easy way to get rid of Chester...</i>

132
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,545
without the guilt
of sending him back to the gutter.

133
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,639
And all it will cost you
is a thousand dollars.

134
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:29,621
<i>Exhibit A:
Steamboat Itchy, dated 1928.</i>

135
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:34,428
The very first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.
And the credits clearly state...

136
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,799
"Written, directed and created
by Roger Myers.

137
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,134

<i>Copyright 1928 by Roger Myers. "</i>

140
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,906
You will also notice Mr. Myers's name
and copyright notice...

141
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,613
on the original drawings of the other members
of the Itchy and Scratchy family:

142
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,951
Brown-Nose Bear,
Disgruntled Goat...

143
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,753
Flatulent Fox,
Rich Uncle Skeleton...

144
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,760
and Dinner Dog.

145
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,263
My client's film predates
all of those things, Your Honor.

146
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,163
Oh, yes! I've forgotten...

147
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,168
your famous film-

148
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,434
the one you destroyed before the trial
and haven't been able to find another copy of.

149
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,441
<i>Oh, yes. That film.</i>

150
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,671
Yes.
You don't have a copy, do you?

151
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,717
Krusty, have you ever seen
this so-called animation genius before?

152
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,184
- Yes, I have.
- You have?

153
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,847
I gave him a couple of blintzes
to paint my fence...

154
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,447
- but he never did it!
- Those blintzes were terrible.

155
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,857
- Paint my fence!
- Make me.

156
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,826
You give me back those blintzes then!

157
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,832
Order! Order!
We don't care about your blintzes.

158
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,734
Now, Mr. Lampwick,
when Roger Myers stole your character-

159
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,738
- Objection.
- Sustained.

160
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,001
If I hear "objection" and "sustained"...

161
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,236
one more time today,
I think I'm going to scream.

162
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,971
- Objection.
- Sustained.

163
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,777
Roger Myers didn't create any of his characters.

164
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,546
- He stole them all.
- Stole them all? That could turn this whole case around.

165
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,351
The only characters Myers could ever
come up with were pathetic stick figures...

166
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,690
with the words "Sarcastic Horse"
and "Manic Mailman" printed on 'em.

167
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,663
And they stank! So he started stealing
other people's characters.

168
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,668
- That's a lie!
- Are you saying- under oath, Mr. Myers-

169
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,797
that your father didn't steal any of the characters
associated with your studio?

170
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,674
Well, I don't think I am under oath,
but yes, my father created them all.

171
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,748
Except for Flatulent Fox.
That was based on a true story.

172
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,909
But he did create Itchy.
That's one thing I am sure of.

173
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:37,546
Mr. Hutz, we've been in here for four hours.
Do you have any evidence at all?

174
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,955
Well, Your Honor,
we've got plenty of hearsay and conjecture.

175
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,028
Those are... kinds of evidence.

176
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,097
Your Honor,
I move for dismissal.

177
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,295
I've got it!
Dad, give me $750.

178
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,701
Okay.

179
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,297
Keep the trial going.
I'll be right back.

180
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,935
Your Honor, I'd like to call
all of my surprise witnesses again.

181
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,481
<i>Oh, there they are.</i>

182
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,279
<i>Oh, they were my favorites.</i>

183
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,980
<i>Thank you.</i>

184
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,253
I knew I had seen this exact scene
somewhere else.

185
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,328
It was in the movie
Mr. Lampwick showed me.

186
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,524
Ladies and gentlemen,
this drawing was made in 1919-

187
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:25,161
nine years before Roger Myers
made his first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.

188
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,640
That could have been drawn by anyone at anytime,
Your Honor. There's no signature or date.

189
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,807
Look under the frame, Brad.

190
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,177
Careful. Careful. Whoops.

191
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,182
It's there!

192
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:42,277
Hmm.
"To Roger Myers. Keep drawing.

193
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,323
"Your moxie more than makes up
for your lack of talent.

194
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,827
Your pal, ChesterJ. Lampwick.
September 3, 1919."

195
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,891
Okay.
Maybe my dad did steal Itchy.

196
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,801
But so what?
Animation is built on plagiarism.

197
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,703
<i>If it weren't for someone plagiarizing
The Honeymooners...</i>

198
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,708
<i>we wouldn't have The Flintstones.</i>

199
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,507
<i>If someone hadn't ripped off Sergeant Bilko,
there'd be no Top Cat.</i>

200
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,072
Huckleberry Hound? Chief Wiggum?
Yogi Bear? Ha!

201
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,744
Andy Griffith. Edward G. Robinson.
Art Carney.

202
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,255
Your Honor, you take away
our right to steal ideas...

203
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,520
where are they gonna come from- her?

204
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,595
Uh- hmm-

205
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,529
How 'bout... Ghost Mutt?

206
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,760
The court rules in favor of Mr. Lampwick.

207
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,863
Itchy & Scratchy Studios
will pay a restitution of $800 billion.

208
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,534
Though that amount will probably
come down a bit on appeal.

209
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,549
I hope you're happy, kid.
The studio's bankrupt.

210
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:53,056
You just killed Itchy and Scratchy.

211
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,355
We killed Itchy and Scratchy?

212
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,988
Good riddance.
Wanna go celebrate?

213
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,363
I feel like liver and onions.

214
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,629
Mmm.

215
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,675
What are you gonna do with all your money,
Mr. Lampwick?

216
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:22,777
Well, first off, here's your thousand dollars
back for hiring that lawyer...

217
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,322
and $750 for the drawing...

218
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,324
and here's a couple of bucks
for your trouble.

219
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,553
Whoo-hoo!
Look, Marge. A couple of bucks!

220
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,496
As for the rest of it, I'm gonna buy
the one thing I've been dreaming of...

221
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,897
all the years I spent in the gutter:

222
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,162
a solid gold house.

223
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:52,116
Well, Itchy and Scratchy are gone, but here's
a cartoon that tries to make learning fun!

224
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,742
Heh-heh-ho-ho-

225
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,014
Sorry about this, kids.
But stay tuned.

226
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,091
We got some real good toy commercials
comin' right up. I swear.

227
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:06,131
<i>- Hey, who left all this garbage
on the steps of Congress?</i>

228
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,131
I'm not garbage.

229
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,260
I'm an amendment to be
Yes, an amendment to be

230
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,568
And I'm hopin' that they'll ratify me

231
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,609
<i>There's a lot offlag burners</i>

232
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,906
<i>Who have got too much freedom</i>

233
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,881
<i>I wanna make it legal
for policemen to beat 'em</i>

234
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,976
<i>'Cause there's limits to our liberties</i>

235
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,851
<i>Least I hope and pray that there are</i>

236
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:35,325
'Cause those liberal freaks go too far

237
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,919
But why can't we just make a law
against flag burning?

238
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,932
<i>Because that law would be unconstitutional.</i>

239
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,934
<i>But if we change the Constitution-</i>

240
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,800
<i>Then we could make all sorts of crazy laws.!</i>

241
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,772
- Now you're catching on.
- What the hell is this?

242
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,641
It's one of those campy, '70s throwbacks
that appeals to Generation X'ers.

243
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,544
We need another Vietnam
to thin out their ranks a little.

244
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,913
What if people say you're not good enough
to be in the Constitution?

245
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,455
Then I'll crush all opposition to me

246
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,422
And I'll make Ted Kennedy pay

247
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,484
If he fights back
I'll say that he's gay

248
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,895
Good news, Amendment.
They ratified ya.

249
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,661
You're in the U.S. Constitution.

250
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,533
<i>Oh, yeah! Door's open, boys.</i>

251
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,143
Whoob-whoob-whoob-whoob.

252
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:30,875
<i>So it's true. Some cartoons
do encourage violence.</i>

253
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,714
- Ow! We gotta get Itchy and Scratchy back.
- And soon!

254
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,720
Ow!

255
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,952
You've got to make more
Itchy and Scratchy cartoons.

256
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,394
The judge says it's okay
as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties.

257
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,397
Royalties? Ha!

258
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,731
I don't have the money to produce the cartoons.
I lost everything.

259
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:55,933
I can't even keep my dad's head
in the freakin' cryogenic center anymore.

260
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,801
Ya comfortable in there, Daddy?

261
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,439
Look, if money's the only problem,
I know a guy who has lots of it.

262
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,945
Shoe shine, sir?
Comb your hair for ya? Sir?

263
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,991
- Humph.
- Sir? Sir? Sir?

264
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,357
Okay.
Catch you on the way back.

265
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,362
- Oh, hi, kids.
- Hi, Chester.

266
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,456
Listen. Would you pay to make
more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons?

267
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,559
- You'll get more royalties.
- I don't need any more money.

268
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,470
I'm not greedy. As long as I've got
my health and my millions of dollars...

269
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,701
and my gold house
and my rocket car...

270
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,107
- I don't need anything else.
- Yes, but-

271
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,443
Not interested.

272
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,314
Dad, can we have
$183,000?

273
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,980
- What for?
- Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.

274
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,818
Oh. Uh- Forget it!

275
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,094
Oh, no. I give up.

276
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,165
- There's nothin' we can do.
- Yeah. I agree.

277
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,997
- You wanna start on tryin' to get Apu out of jail?
- Okay.

278
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:05,302
<i>Wait, kids. You can't give up on Itchy and Scratchy.
You're always so good at these things.</i>

279
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,810
Why, together you've reunited
Krusty with his father...

280
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,006
gotten Principal Skinner his job back...

281
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,176
and helped Dr. Riviera perform
open heart surgery on your father.

282
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:19,121
You've even foiled Sideshow Bob on five
separate occasions, and he's an evil genius.

283
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:23,957
You're right, Mom. I'm sure if we put
our minds to it we can solve this one too.

284
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,366
Bart, look at this!

285
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,438
What a perfect plan.

286
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,837
Now Roger Myers's hotel is just-

287
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,537
And, so, when no one could
think of a plan to resurrect Itchy and Scratchy...

288
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,878
a young boy-
a wonderful, irrepressible young boy-

289
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,611
took it on his own
to solve the problem.

290
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,519
He discovered
that the Postal Service's Mr. Zip...

291
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:57,084
was just a rip-off of my father's
stick figure character Manic Mailman.

292
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:02,600
<i>- So the government gave me
a huge cash settlement...</i>

293
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,398
and Itchy & Scratchy Studios
is back in business.

294
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,633
Thanks to you, Lester.

295
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,909
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

296
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,473
But it looks like you might have
a little competition all of a sudden.

297
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,783
Thanks, everybody.
But I couldn't have done all this...

298
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,517
without the help
of my brainy sister, Eliza.

299
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,989
I, too, owe many thanks
to Lester and Eliza.

300
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,932
This is a great vindication for anybody
who was ever taking a bath...

301
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:41,369
went to get the paper, fell down and had the door
slam behind them and the doorknob break off.

302
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:46,001
And I'd like to thank Lester
for reuniting me with my estranged wife.

303
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,272
- I never even heard about that.
- I don't understand it.

304
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,578
We're always the ones
who solve these problems.

305
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:59,085
I guess you don't need it now,
but... we had a plan too.

306
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:03,992
Hey, great. Listen. Write it down and mail it
to last week, when I might have cared.

307
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,656
I've got cartoons to make, kids.

308
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,800
<i>And Scratchy Show</i>

309
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,572
Huh?

310
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,227
You kids must be so happy.

311
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,422
- Your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air.
- Yes.

312
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,227
Well, technically everything
worked out all right, but-

313
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,428
- But?
- Well, I wasn't the one who solved the problem...

314
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,437
and neither was Lisa.

315
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,565
<i>There's something unsettling about that.</i>

316
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,028
Shh!
