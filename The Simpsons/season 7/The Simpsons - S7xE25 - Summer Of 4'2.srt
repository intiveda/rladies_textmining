1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,270
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,478
D'oh!

3
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,530
Hey, Bart! Summer's almost here.

4
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,599
Which kind of sprinkler do you like?

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,569
The one that goes like this?

6
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:43,574
Or the one that goes like this?

7
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:47,737
Oh, and there's this one!

8
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,475
It's the last day of school, Milhouse.

9
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,074
Try to show some dignity.

10
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,550
Gentlemen, start your chimes.

11
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,932
School's out! Up yours, Krabappel!

12
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,901
Well, I'm glad the rest
of you remembered...

13
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,000
that summer vacation starts
at the end of the day...

14
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,011
not the beginning.

15
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,412
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Hmm. Quick work.

16
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,416
How'd you know he was gonna run?

17
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,543
We've got someone on the inside.

18
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:39,187
The reward for
a year's worth of toil and sacrifice.

19
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,201
<i>Retrospecticus. Oh.</i>

20
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,209
The leatheroleum covers
were worth the extra money!

21
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,336
Oh! You can smell the benzene!

22
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,040
Oh, when the kids see
these layouts and fonts...

23
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,209
you're going to be the most
popular girl in school!

24
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,982
You know something, Beezee?
I think you're right.

25
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:07,150
"And so, as Abraham Lincoln sat
in Ford's Theatre that night...

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,560
John Wilkes Booth entered,
drew his gun and"-

27
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,224
Well, that's it. Have a nice summer, everyone.

28
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,962
But what happened in Ford's Theatre?

29
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,038
Was President Lincoln okay?

30
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,107
He was fine.

31
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,377
Go home, Ralph.

32
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,437
In the beginning of the school year,
each of you received a colored ticket.

33
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,848
I hope everyone still has theirs.

34
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,147
Who died and made you boss?

35
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:39,692
Mr. Estes, the publications adviser.
I edited the whole thing.

36
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:44,252
If you hadn't done it, some other loser
would have, so quit milking it.

37
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,998
Hey! Will you guys sign my yearbook?

38
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,024
Huh?

39
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,587
This is Becky.
She's in the second grade.

40
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,164
Hi, Becky.
Thanks for coming out.

41
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,164
"See ya. "
He writes the way people talk!

42
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,764
Your daughter is named Seymour?

43
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,901
Well, I-Yeah.

44
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,605
I lied. It's for me.

45
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,375
I don't get it. Straight A's,
perfect attendance, bathroom timer-

46
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:44,047
I should be
the most popular girl in school.

47
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,287
Homer, I'm in a rhubarb
of a pickle of a jam here.

48
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,922
I was all set to go off on vacation
when I get called up for jury duty.

49
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,932
Oh, it's a corker of a case.

50
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,559
Seems a man drove up
onto a traffic island...

51
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,639
and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums.

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,538
Now they're trying it
as a maritime offense.

53
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,511
So, anyhoo, how'd you like to use
my beach house, free of charge?

54
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,082
I only get two weeks
of vacation a year...

55
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,380
and you want me to spend it
in your lousy beach house?

56
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,319
Well, if it'll seal the deal...

57
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,119
I'll take a look at your septic tank,
see if I can get her humming again.

58
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,990
Deal! See, Flanders?
You give a little, you get a little.

59
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,159
Hello, Mr. Brown Ground.
What you got for me?

60
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,726
<i>And you're sure
the Flanderses won't be there?</i>

61
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,772
<i>Well, it sounds great.</i>

62
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,898
Bart, you can invite Milhouse.

63
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,274
- Lisa, you can bring a friend too.
- Hey, great!

64
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,643
A friend-

65
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,716
or a companion...

66
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,046
or- I don't know- a stuffed animal.

67
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,012
Well, did you call one of your friends?

68
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,023
Friends? Huh!

69
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,891
These are my only friends-
grown-up nerds like Gore Vidal.

70
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,691
And even he's kissed more boys
than I ever will.

71
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,892
Girls, Lisa. Boys kiss girls.

72
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,664
- Mom, why don't I have any friends?
- We have each other.

73
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,740
When I was a lonely little girl...

74
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,573
I always dreamed that someday
my daughter would be my best friend.

75
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,580
We are best friends, Mom,
but I'm a kid.

76
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,741
I need friends my own age too.

77
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,818
Honey, you'll make plenty of friends.

78
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,387
All you have to do is be yourself.

79
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,090
Be myself? I've been myself for eight years,
and it hasn't worked.

80
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,424
Look at all these dorky clothes.

81
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,125
A bathing cap, nose plugs.

82
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,567
A microscope at the beach?
Aah! What was I thinking?

83
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,272
Mom, I'm gonna tighten Milhouse's straps.
He's fidgeting again.

84
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,109
Ow!

85
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,739
Lisa, let's go!

86
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,054
Here- Hmm.
Somebody's traveling light.

87
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,146
Nah. Maybe you're getting stronger.

88
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,919
Well, I have been eating more.

89
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,728
Wave bye-bye to our house, Maggie.
Bye-bye, tree.

90
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,736
- Bye-bye, job.
- Bye-bye, toothbrush.

91
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,806
Bye-bye, Lisa Simpson.

92
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,713
When the hell are we gonna get to-
Where the hell are we going?

93
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,844
It's called
Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport.

94
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,685
It's known as America's scrod basket.

95
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,191
I thought Springfield
was America's scrod basket.

96
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,720
No. Springfield
is America's crud bucket...

97
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,228
<i>at least according to Newsweek.</i>

98
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,801
"Wel-diddly-elcome, Simpsons. "

99
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,814
- Oh, geez! He actually wrote "diddly. "
- That was thoughtful.

100
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,044
"I left a few helpful notes
around the house. "

101
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,616
<i>Ah, come- Gee.!</i>

102
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,617
- "Put food in me. "
- I'll take that.

103
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,228
Well, duh! With what, Ned?

104
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,839
Nice try, Todd.

105
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,845
Isn't this fun, honey?

106
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,575
It must be exciting to make
a different set of beds.

107
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,447
I know you're joking, but it is!

108
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,522
Say, why don't you put on your swimsuit
and head for the beach?

109
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,522
Well, it's kind of funny.

110
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:43,584
With all the craziness and confusion
and meshuggaas of packing, I forgot to pack!

111
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,857
Lisa, that's not at all like you.

112
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,933
<i>- Exactly.
- Hmm.</i>

113
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,528
I forgot my swimsuit, too,
but I improvised.

114
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,538
<i>Hello.</i>

115
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,377
Uh, Mom, I'm kind of trying to go
for a different look this year.

116
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,645
Oh, okay.

117
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,620
Ooh! How about
this adorable sunsuit?

118
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,887
It has a starfish on the fanny,
and it comes with its own pail.

119
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,861
<i>Mom, come here.! Bring money.!</i>

120
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,004
So, where do you want to
show off your new, hip togs?

121
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,300
The Sherbet Shop, the Candle District?

122
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,841
Big Sue's Tap-Water Taffy?

123
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:35,175
If it's okay with you, Mom,
I'd rather go find some kids.

124
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,250
Oh. Okay.

125
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,520
You'll be my friend.

126
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,489
I'm never, never gonna
let you get away.

127
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,054
Hey, hey!

128
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,493
Last one in is a yearbook editor!

129
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,896
Full speed ahead!
Prepare to dive! Dive!

130
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,299
It's low tide, boys.

131
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,747
I wonder where all the kids are.

132
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,408
Hey! A library!

133
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,918
No, I can't.
That's the old, nerdy Lisa.

134
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,323
Lisa, read about my adventures
in the South Seas...

135
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,189
and make me live again.

136
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,288
We've got periodicals on microfiche.

137
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,137
Won't you join our tea party?
It would be ever so-

138
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,729
Don't do it, Lisa! It's a trick! Run!

139
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,740
<i>Run.!</i>

140
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,574
Oh. I don't see any kids at all.

141
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,411
It's like they ditched me in advance.

142
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,145
<i>So he goes, like-</i>

143
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,721
<i>I can totally hear him going that.</i>

144
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,620
Only kids are that incoherent!

145
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,394
So, my mom tried to take me to some
candle place, but I'm all, like, "No way. "

146
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,539
Like, you know, whatever.

147
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,608
Like, you know, whatever.

148
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,542
Hey! What's hap-

149
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,842
Okay, okay, okay.
Not your fault. It's a bird thing.

150
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,916
You don't control the birds.

151
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,508
You will someday, but not now.

152
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,281
- Hi.
- 'Sup?

153
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,356
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Some kid.

154
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,357
Hey! I like your hat.

155
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,188
A compliment!

156
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:33,197
Scanning for sarcasm. It's clean. Go!

157
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,426
Thanks.

158
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,094
Um, you guys skate?

159
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,696
Try to. The cops always
confiscate our boards.

160
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:46,107
Yeah. And you just know they're using them,
like, five minutes later down at the station.

161
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,807
Hmm. I think I know a place
you can skate that's virtually deserted.

162
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,447
Like, you know, whatever.

163
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,953
- All right!
- Excellent!

164
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,489
<i>Okay.</i>

165
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,486
Hey, this place rocks!
What'd you say your name was?

166
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,259
- Didn't. It's Lisa.
- I'm Erin.

167
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,130
So, how'd you know about this place?
You into books?

168
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,136
Me? Unlikely.

169
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:17,073
My gooney brother's always going to libraries.
I usually hang out in front.

170
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,907
- Oh. You like hanging out too?
- Well, it beats doin' stuff.

171
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,981
Yeah. Stuff sucks.

172
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,550
Hey, you up?
You can use my board.

173
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,586
No! Okay. Thanks.

174
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,283
That's very, um, rad of you.

175
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,388
Hmm.

176
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,492
Hey, Bart! Lisa's skateboarding
with some cool kids.

177
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,161
And she looks like Blossom.

178
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,297
Lisa? With people?

179
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,342
If they're impressed by her,
I'm gonna Bart their world.

180
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,412
Okay, Milhouse, you know the drill.

181
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,846
Right. You go over and wow them.
I hide in the shrubs.

182
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,012
<i>Hot stuff comin'through.</i>

183
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,927
My friendship-
You know you want it.

184
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,622
That kid, like, tries too hard.

185
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,565
Sh'yeah! The whole thing
smacks of effort, man.

186
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:20,503
That's my dorky little brother,
Bart- holomew.

187
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:24,770
Who does he think he is with that slingshot
in his back pocket? Dennis the Menace?

188
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,176
<i>Mr. Wilson or something.</i>

189
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,805
How'd it go?
Are we down with them?

190
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,908
No! They must've seen you.

191
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,018
Oh, why do we have to play
this lousy old game?

192
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,423
Because it was
the only one in the house.

193
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,223
Come on, Homer.
Open the door for your mystery date.

194
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,195
Ooh!

195
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,893
Captain of the football team.
He's a dreamboat.

196
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,436
Don't wait up, Marge.

197
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,166
Okay, Bart. Your turn, your turn.

198
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,809
You got the dud!

199
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:07,011
Hey, he looks just like you,
Poindexter!

200
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,317
How come Lisa doesn't have to play?
Why does she get to hang out with her friends?

201
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,516
You got friends.
You got the dud right here.

202
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,560
Stand up for yourself, Poindexter.

203
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:27,137
<i>Wow, Lisa.! I never appreciated
all this, like, sea junk before.</i>

204
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,265
- Hey, that clam's got legs!
- That's a hermit crab.

205
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,812
When she outgrows her old shell,
she finds a new one that's a better fit.

206
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,881
<i>Don't be afraid, little friend.</i>

207
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,142
<i>You'll be the most popular crab
on the beach.</i>

208
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,744
Aw, a gift from my favorite crustacean.

209
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,154
Um, did you learn that word
from a teacher or something?

210
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:50,126
<i>No. No, I heard it on Baywatch.</i>

211
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,129
- Oh, cool.
- That's cool.

212
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,199
<i>Baywatch. David Hasselhoff, man.</i>

213
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,397
Ah. I bet this place sells
illegal fireworks.

214
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,875
Just go in and act casual
like you buy 'em all the time.

215
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,946
Hi. Um-

216
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:13,849
Let me have one of those porno magazines,
large box of condoms...

217
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,116
a bottle of Old Harper,
a couple of those panty shields...

218
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,123
and some illegal fireworks...

219
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,184
and one of those disposable enemas-
no, make it two.

220
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,321
My apologies, sir,
but the sale of fireworks...

221
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,957
is prohibited in this state
and is punishable by-

222
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,161
Follow me.

223
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,066
Any red-blooded,
flag-feeding American would love...

224
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,476
<i>the M-320.</i>

225
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,812
Celebrate the independence of your nation
by blowing up a small part of it.

226
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,283
All right.

227
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,650
Pretty cool of your mom
to let us hang out here.

228
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,655
Totally. Not like my mom.

229
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:55,420
She'd be butting in
with Rice Krispies squares and Tang.

230
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,496
My dad's all stoked
'cause today's the Fourth ofJuly.

231
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,226
- He woke me up at dawn to take a loyalty oath.
- Ugh.

232
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,361
My mom's French,
so we only celebrate Bastille Day.

233
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,306
Well, we could do something fun.
Um, how 'bout a beach party?

234
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,173
- Oh, great idea, Lise.
- Hey, I know where there's a beach!

235
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,338
I know where we could
get some baguettes.

236
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,545
Gee, I don't know what you've
got planned for tonight, Homer...

237
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,745
but count me out.

238
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,981
Didn't you buy any meat?

239
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,387
This baby's sure to kill something.

240
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,485
Okay now, everybody.
Stand back while I celebrate freedom!

241
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,622
- Bart, give me your matches.
- Fresh out.

242
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,929
No lighter? Nothing?

243
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,527
Oh! Wait. I got it.

244
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,443
D'oh!

245
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,314
The beer!

246
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,267
Oh! This is the worst Fourth ofJuly ever.
I hate America.

247
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,499
Come on, Milhouse.
Let's go down there.

248
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,600
I don't think you should.
Let Lisa be alone with her new friends.

249
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,273
They're my friends rightfully.
She only got them by copying me.

250
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,316
Don't have a cow, man!

251
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,317
See? That's my expression!

252
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,082
Oh. You haven't said that in four years.
Let Lisa have it.

253
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,590
It's the principle. She's gotta learn.

254
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,456
No! Now, park your keister, "meister. "

255
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,695
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

256
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,866
Hey, Lise. I made something for you.
It's a friendship bracelet.

257
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,533
For me? Wow!

258
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,305
My first real friend... ship bracelet.

259
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:58,907
I don't have anything for you,
except this necklace I made.

260
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,987
Oh, cool. Thanks.

261
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,248
Hey, cinnamon dental floss!

262
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,814
I just know we're
gonna be friends forever.

263
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,828
So, Lisa has a friend.
We'll see about that.

264
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,870
Bart! I need my glasses.

265
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,499
Oh. Nice doggy.

266
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,551
I'm dizzy! I'm nauseous!

267
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,355
Oh, but I'm popular!

268
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,989
Huh?

269
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,036
What's he doing here?
My yearbook. No!

270
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,402
Mm-hmm.

271
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,476
Hey, you guys! You want to see
how cool Lisa Simpson really is?

272
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,738
Check this out.

273
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,746
<i>Miss Perfect Attendance...</i>

274
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,079
Grammar Rodeo head buckaroo,
the French table.

275
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,085
Ooh-la-la!

276
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,156
"Teacher's pet"?

277
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,403
Hey, Lise.

278
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,704
I guess my little yearbook stunt
was pretty rough...

279
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,801
but it did teach you a lesson.

280
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,574
It's important to be yourself.

281
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,751
I know exactly who I am.

282
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:44,186
I am the sister of a rotten,
jealous, mean, little sneak!

283
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,757
You cost me my only friends!

284
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,054
You've ruined my life!

285
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,687
Hey, kids!
There's a carnival tonight!

286
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,901
Oh, boy! A carnival!

287
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,639
Hmm.

288
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,044
Kids, stop that!
Don't make me get the carny!

289
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,853
Hey, Lisa! Make friends with this!

290
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,587
Hey!

291
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,457
Help! Help!

292
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:28,397
Remember, kids, there's no need to bump.
Just enjoy the ride.

293
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,300
Oh!

294
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,624
Lisa, wait!

295
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,760
Being myself didn't work.

296
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,427
Being someone else didn't work.

297
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,061
Maybe I just wasn't meant
to have friends.

298
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,640
<i>Lisa is gonna freak when she sees this.</i>

299
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,141
Well, hurry up. They'll be back soon.

300
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,211
Lisa!

301
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,875
Okay. You found out
I'm an overachieving bookworm.

302
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:23,546
So whatever mean prank you're pulling,
just finish it up and send me a Polaroid.

303
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,556
<i>- I'm going to sleep.
- Wait, Lisa.! Look.</i>

304
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,993
Huh? Oh!

305
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,760
- Oh! Oh!
- Cool, huh?

306
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,836
Well, now you can take the beach
with you wherever you go.

307
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,337
Uh, but don't drive at night.

308
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,772
Does this mean you still
want to be friends...

309
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,174
even though I tried to cover up
my nerdish leanings?

310
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,907
Look, we don't care who you were...

311
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,882
and you can't fake the kind
of good person that you are.

312
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,419
Yeah. You taught us
about cool things...

313
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,887
like nature and why
we shouldn't drink seawater.

314
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,459
This is the most thoughtful
thing anybody ever-

315
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,961
<i>Sweet merciful crap.! My car.!</i>

316
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,965
The polite thing to do
would've been to clean the shells first.

317
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,867
Shoo! Shoo!

318
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,133
I guess I should give this back to you.

319
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,709
I showed it to your friends again
before we left.

320
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,710
- Bart!
- Look inside.

321
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:30,048
Oh. Thanks, Bart.

322
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,318
I signed it too.

323
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,819
Uh-huh.

324
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,897
Well, get a last look at
the beautiful ocean scenery, kids.

325
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,427
Shh!
