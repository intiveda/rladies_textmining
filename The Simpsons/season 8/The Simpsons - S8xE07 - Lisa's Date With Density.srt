Go back to bed, Mother.
I've got it under control.

Listen, you crumb-bums. If you think
I'm impressed, I am not. l- [Shudders]

337
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,983
Oh, brandishing your buttocks
is only getting me angrier.

Lisa, the cops are chasing me.
I need a place to hide!

And I wasn't even there! Honest!
Skinner's just out to get me.

- That's so unfair.
<i>- [Siren Wails]</i>

351
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,861
- Uh-oh.
- Meet me at the back door.

352
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,365
Aha! I had a feeling
we'd find you here.

353

- Chief, no!
- What'd you do that for?

Well, the thing's been
driving the whole town nuts.

355

Got me out of the bath
seven times- seven.

Hey! Who shot the auto-dialer?

357
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,782
- Uh, Marge's auto-dialer.
- See you in court, Simpson.

358
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,944
Oh, and, uh,
bring that evidence with you.

359
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,955
Otherwise, I got no case,
and you'll go scot-free, you know.

360
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,082
Uh, Chief, what about
those coleslaw punks?

361
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,788
Well, l- I can't be everywhere at once, Lou,
now can I?

362
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,696
You know, in most cities, the chief of police
doesn't even go out on calls like these.

363
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,768
- Yeah, yeah. We know, Chief.
- We appreciate it.

364
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,962
- Count our blessings every day.
- We're very appreciative.

<i>I think they're giving up.</i>

366
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,642
Thanks for helping me out.
You're a stand-up babe.

00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:17,977
Hey, check it out.
Skinner's mopping the goo off his house!

Huh? Oh. Yeah.

373
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,223

- You lied to me.

- Nuh-uh!
- There. You did it again.

375
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,529
All right, all right. I lied.
I'm sorry. Let's kiss.

376
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,606
No! You don't understand,
Nelson.

377
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,642
A kiss doesn't mean anything
if it's dishonest.

378
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,110
Um-There's, uh, niceness to it.

379
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,943
I was foolish to think
I'd actually changed you.

380
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,075
Maybe I was seeing things
in you that weren't really there.

381
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,883
- Definitely.
- Then why did you want to be with me?

382
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,255
Mmm-mmm. Maybe 'cause you
were the first person...

383
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,828
that ever thought there was
a nice guy inside me.

384

Huh. Well, guess you
really blew that one, huh?

385
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,267
- Well, I guess this is it.
- You mean, like, good-bye?

Hi, Lisa.

390
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,856
Could I talk to you, or will that just
make Nelson whale on me again?

391
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,091
Don't worry.
Nelson and I don't like each other anymore.

392
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:45,260
[Gasps] Really? You got anybody in mind
for your next crush?

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,931
Well, I'm really not
thinking about that now.
