00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,203
Hang in there, Homer!
Only 440 more seconds.

322
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,366
He's gettin'
his second wind.

323
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,139
No, he's gettin' killed!
He's gonna die on his feet.

324
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,215
[Groans]
I can't watch this. I gotta get outta here.

[Shouting Continues]

327
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,991
Somebody stop the fight!
Where's the doctor?

328
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,992
Kill him!
Kill him!

<i>It looks like it's all over.</i>

330
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,231
<i>Tatum wants to finish this</i>

331

<i>And here it comes.</i>

332
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:20,078
<i>Oh, my God! Simpson's manager has flown</i>

[Slurring]
Are you an angel?

336
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,727
Yes, Homer. I'm an angel.
All us angels wear Farah slacks.

337
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,699
But you stopped the fight.
Won't everyone be mad at you?

338
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:41,000
Ah, let 'em be mad. The only thing
that matters to me is you're safe.

339
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,904
- D'oh!
- Sorry.

340
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,815
Homer, your manager obviously
loves you very much.

341
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,182
Lucius, would you
do that for me?

342
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,187
Absolutely, I would.
[Chuckles]

343
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,917
Now get in the van.

344
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:04,291
You couldn't even give me
one lousy round, Moe.

345
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,296
You will always be a loser.

346
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:10,095
Now take your check for a hundred thousand
dollars and get out of my sight.

347
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,500
I don't need
your stinkin' money!

348
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,799
Oh, Homie,
are you okay?

349
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,309
I can't remember
where we parked.

350
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,312
Oh, that's all right.

351
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,541
We'll just wait
till everyone else leaves.

352
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,618
I got your tooth, Dad.

353
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,420
Uh, not mine.

354
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,889
Thank you, Moe. I know you gave up
your dreams for Homer.

355
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,085
Well, what do dreams
matter, Marge?

356
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,389
I was able to stick up
for a pal.

357
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,594
Well, so long, Springfield.

358
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,761
- Where are you goin'?
- Oh, nowheres in particular.

359
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,034
I just need
some time to think.
