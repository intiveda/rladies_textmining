2
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:41,998
Man! Rusty old hunk of junk!

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,202
Howdy, Bart.
Hot enough for ya?

4
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:48,905
Shut up, Flanders.

5
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:52,576
Hey, Dad, how come we can't get
a decent mower, like the Flanders have?

6
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,713
Just be happy with what you've got, son.
Don't try to keep up with the Flanders'.

7
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:03,220
Whoa!

8
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:05,722
How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?

9
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:09,393
Oh, wow, man!
What an RV!

10
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:13,096
Bart! Uh, I suppose it has,
uh, various features.

11
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,899
Oh, it's got everything--
microwave, dish washer,

12
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,969
big screen TV, deep fryer
and, oh, see up there on the roof?

13
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:22,306
- A satellite dish!
- Yes, indeedly-doodly.

14
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:25,209
But, uh, how can you afford
something like this, Ned?

15
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:29,279
I get your mail once in a while, and
you make only $27 a week more than I do.

16
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,215
Oh, it's simple, Simpson. Credit.

17
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:32,716
Ooh, credit!

18
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:38,789
Hmm! Mmm!

19
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:40,891
Oh! Ah!

20
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:44,728
Thank you, God.

21
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,730
May I help you?

22
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,666
We're just browsing.
Thank you.

23
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:52,603
I'd like to see your finest RV.
Do you have something that's
better than the Land Behemoth?

24
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,906
Yes we do. That would be
the Ultimate Behemoth.

25
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:59,410
- Where is it?
- You are standing in its presence.

26
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:02,313
- Behold!
- Oh, wow!

27
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:06,116
Would you look at this thing?
Man built this. It's a vehicle.

28
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:08,118
Does it have
its own satellite dish, sir?

29
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:12,289
You can tell your son
it has its own satellite.

30
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:16,093
The Van Star One, launched last February,
just for this thing, that's all.

31
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:19,096
- Whoa, man!
- I'm not sure that we can afford--

32
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:21,699
- Does it have a deep fryer?
- It has four of them--

33
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,701
one for each part
of the chicken.

34
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,503
I don't think
we can afford this.

35
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:29,507
Let's worry about that later. Come on.
Let's take a tour. Want to? Come on

36
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,680
- Ay, caramba.
- This is better than our house.

37
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,815
Wait till Flanders
gets a load of this.

38
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:40,818
Seems so expensive.

39
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:43,888
Hey!

40
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:45,890
- How much is it?
- Oh.

41
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,994
You're a man of your convict--
You just wanted to ask that
and blurted it out, didn't ya?

42
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:52,597
- Yeah. How much is it?
- Well,

43
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:55,600
first of all, I want you to know
I like your face.

44
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,902
- You do?
- I really do.

45
00:03:57,902 --> 00:04:01,005
I'm not saying that. I mean it.
You got color in there.

46
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,007
- You're not Roman, are you?
- No!

47
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,209
Look like a god, sort of.

48
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,012
Why don't we step
into the credit office, Zeus?

49
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,015
Hey, your dad's gonna just go in here,

50
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:13,084
work it out and you'll,
you'll drive home in this!

51
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,088
I'm not gonna quote you
a price till I check your credit rating.

52
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:21,192
And let me-- I want to make myself
clear on this. This is a formality.

53
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:23,795
If you're saying to me,
" Bob, is this guy good for it?"

54
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:27,966
I say,"Yes." I don't check
this machine, but I don't own the place,

55
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,968
even though my name's up there.

56
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:33,772
Long story, but that
doesn't matter. I'm gonna have
to run it through the computer.

57
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:38,476
Is that a good siren?
Am I approved?

58
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:41,212
You ever known a siren to be good?

59
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,582
No, Mr. Simpson, it's not.
It's a bad siren.

60
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,218
That's the computer in case
I went blind, telling me,

61
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:50,088
"Sell the vehicle to this fella,
and you're out of business."

62
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:51,890
- That's what the siren says.
- Oh.

63
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,594
Seems the Ultimate Behemoth
is a wee bit out of your price range.

64
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,396
And "weebit"
is me bein' polite.

65
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:01,166
You couldn't afford this thing
if you lived to be a million.

66
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:04,603
Don't you have something that
isn't out of my price range?

67
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,972
I don't wanna go away
empty-handed, Bob.

68
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:10,108
Take it easy there. Don't ruin
this feeling I'm gettin' from ya.

69
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,611
Perhaps I can show you
something, uh...

70
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,913
a little more you.

71
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,784
Well, what do you think?

72
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,086
You gotta be kidding me.

73
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,422
- Used, isn't it?
- What'd you say?

74
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:27,593
- Uh, is it used?
- Mr. Simpson, you're never
gonna own a better RV.

75
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:29,695
I don't mean that in a good way.
I mean literally.

76
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:32,197
This is it for you, you know?
It's this or a wagon.

77
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:34,299
Then... uh, how much
do you want for it?

78
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,302
This is yours. You're not
gonna hand it to someone else?

79
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:39,872
'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for
you. Someone else, I'm doublin' this.

80
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,874
- I swear it, Bob.
- This is you and me.

81
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:45,177
- Yeah.
- Two months from now,
your head's in that window.

82
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,980
- On my honor.
- 350 a month.

83
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:51,583
Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be all
right if l conferred with my family?

84
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,987
Mr. Simpson, if you have to talk it over
with those humans out there,

85
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,989
there's something wrong
with all of us.

86
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,694
You look like a man able to make
a decision. See that man over there?

87
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,896
- Yeah.
- He's buying this. Did you know that?

88
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:07,900
Called me, said, "Save the little one.
I'm coming." Here he is.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,870
- Now you want it or not?
- All right, all right. I'll take it!

90
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,874
Best decision you ever made.
You are gonna-- You are gonna--
This is gonna change your life.

91
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,783
Hey, Flanders.
Look what I got.

92
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,186
Oh, she's a beaut!
Hey, congratulations!

93
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,288
I'm sure you'll have
loads of fun.

94
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,458
Jealous. Everybody ready?

95
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,593
I hate this.
I don't wanna go.

96
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,263
That's the spirit.
Ready or not, nature,

97
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,398
here we come!

98
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,207
Turkey farm, skunks, slaughterhouse?
No, no, no.

99
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,410
- What are you doing back there?
- We're playing,"What's that odor?"

100
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,879
- Dad's feet?
- Bart!

101
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,714
- You win, Bart.
- Lisa!

102
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,885
- Are we there yet, Dad?
- I'll tell you when.
Go back to your smell game.

103
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,591
Homer, I'm telling you.

104
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,795
- This is not the interstate.
- Maps.

105
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:12,098
Shouldn't we stop somewhere
and ask for directions?

106
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,468
Don't worry.
This is an all-terrain vehicle.

107
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,473
My feet are getting wet!

108
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,676
Oh, come on.
We're getting back to nature.

109
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,479
- Mom, I'm scared.
- We all are, dear.

110
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,482
Your father says there's nothing
to worry about.

111
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,066
- What do you think?
Should we stop here?
- Yes!

112
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,867
All righty.

113
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,807
Well, here we are.

114
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:08,889
Okay, nobody move, and nobody panic.

115
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,193
When I give the word,
everyone, ever so slowly,

116
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,363
open your door and slide out.

117
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,199
On the count of three. One--

118
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,284
The Simpsons
have entered the forest.

119
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:47,761
Well, ha, ha.
Now we get a chance to be real pioneers.

120
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,397
Yes, sir.
This is a real adventure.

121
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:54,768
Why, I bet there are people
who would trade everything they
have in the world for this.

122
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,471
You mean, like we just did?

123
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,574
- Will somebody help her?
- Look, Maggie. Birdies.

124
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,580
Oh, Homer,
what are we going to do?

125
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:10,084
Now don't worry.
Our situation isn't as bad as it seems.

126
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,087
And you're forgetting.
I'm an experienced woodsman.

127
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:17,158
Now you all stay here while I go over
this way and try to get my bearings.

128
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,901
What am I gonna do?
I've murdered us all!

129
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,104
I've murdered us all!
I've murdered us all!

130
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:32,973
- Shut up!
- Shut up! Shut up!

131
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,542
- D-oh!
- D-oh! D-oh!

132
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:39,480
- There. Finished.
- You are?

133
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,549
Well, it's a quick job,
but it's shelter.

134
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,084
- It is?
- Uh-huh.

135
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,686
Okay. We'll be back with help
before you know it.

136
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,489
You girls just stay here
and relax.

137
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:51,659
Remember, the handle of the Big Dipper
points to the North Star.

138
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,796
That's nice, Lisa,
but we're not in astronomy class.

139
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,365
We're in the woods.

140
00:10:05,473 --> 00:10:07,575
Should Maggie
be going with them?

141
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:10,978
I don't think they'll be gone
long, and she's in good hands.

142
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,553
There aren't any dangerous animals...

143
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,555
in the forest, are there, Dad?

144
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:24,359
Might be a few, but don't worry.
If you leave them alone,
they'll leave you alone.

145
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:27,262
- It's a deal.
- And remember not to act afraid.

146
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:30,198
Animals can smell fear,
and they don't like it.

147
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:34,169
- Besides, there's
nothing to be afraid of.
- Right.

148
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:37,872
A rattler!

149
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:40,175
- I'm not afraid!
- Run, you fool!

150
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:55,090
Through here, boy.
Back to civilization.

151
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,892
- How do you know?
- When you're an experienced
woodsman like me,

152
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,894
you get a feel
for these things.

153
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,397
It becomes natural,
like a third sense.

154
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:24,386
The boys certainly
are taking a long time.

155
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:27,589
I hope Maggie isn't
slowing them up too much.

156
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:50,546
Bart! Where are you, Bart?

157
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,982
His lucky red hat.
Oh, dear God!

158
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,285
No! Bart!

159
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,787
Bart! Bart!

160
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:07,963
Oh, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son!

161
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:10,065
Why couldn't You
have taken me?

162
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,368
Of all the fates
on heaven and earth,

163
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:14,970
why did this one befall me?

164
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,074
Don't have a cow, Dad.

165
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:21,043
What the-- D-oh!

166
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:24,380
You're alive! And buck naked.

167
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,382
I'm not the only one,
Home boy.

168
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:29,351
What? Oh!

169
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:32,354
Jungle man.

170
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:51,874
The first thing you learn about
surviving in the woods, boy:
conceal your nakedness.

171
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:55,945
- Yeah, man.
- Okay. Slap a fern on there, boy.

172
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,381
And now with some mud.

173
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,383
There. Ooh!

174
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:02,385
That requires a little moss.

175
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:05,755
And some moss for me.
All right.

176
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:09,392
- Ready to hit the town.
- But, Dad, I am so hungry!

177
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,161
Can't we eat somethin' first?
I'm starvin', man.

178
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:14,464
Ah, food.
Good thinking, son.

179
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:17,367
This young sapling
ought to do the trick.

180
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,839
- What are we gonna do, hang ourselves?
- No!

181
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:26,142
This is a trap. It's gonna catch
us our dinner. Come on, boy.

182
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:29,145
Shh! Just watch.

183
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:33,149
Oooh!

184
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,352
A-ha! Got him!

185
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:42,459
Okay, okay.

186
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:45,361
This time I'll just
go into the bushes over there,

187
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:48,164
make a lot of noise
and flush out a rabbit.

188
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:50,533
And when he comes out,
you step on him.

189
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,035
Right, Dad.

190
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,339
Get 'em off me!

191
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:58,675
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!

192
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:10,153
Great camping trip, honey. Traveled 800
miles, haven't even seen a squirrel yet.

193
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,789
Well, the ranger at the gate
said we should watch out for bears.

194
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,958
- Oh, bears!
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:18,061
Right, right. Let me show you
how many bears there are around here.

196
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:20,864
Uh, hello, bears!

197
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:23,467
Um, come on.
Have a donut.

198
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,736
Oh, what the heck, have me!
Come and get it!

199
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:28,538
All right, all right.
You made your point.

200
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:31,375
Bears.

201
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,378
- I hope Maggie
and the boys are all right.
- Oh, I'm sure they're just fine.

202
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:11,382
After all, we built a fire,
and we don't know anything about nature.

203
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:14,952
Imagine what your father,
an experienced woodsman, has done.

204
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:18,055
Yeah, I suppose so.
Good night, Mom.

205
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:22,059
Good night, dear.

206
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:28,465
G-G-Good n-n-night, D-D-Dad.

207
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:31,268
- G-G-Good n-n-night, son.

208
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:34,271
Sleep tight.

209
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:52,156
- Are we there yet?
- No!

210
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,358
- Are we ever gonna be there?
- How would I know?

211
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,261
Quit asking pointless--

212
00:15:57,361 --> 00:15:59,530
- Bart, look!

213
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:01,966
Honey. Honey!

214
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:05,770
- We're saved!
- Uh, Homer. Bees?

215
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:10,641
- How is it?
- Tangy.

216
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:18,449
What?

217
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:22,453
- Oh, water. That-a-way, man.

218
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:49,180
Bigfoot. The legendary half-man
half-ape is no longer a legend.

219
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,550
He's very, very real. What you're about
to see is unedited video footage...

220
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,554
taken earlier today in the hills three
miles southwest of Tenderfoot George.

221
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:06,665
Now, the naturalist who took these
absolutely extraordinay pictures...

222
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:09,367
was most impressed with
the creature's uncivilized look,

223
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:13,872
it’s foul language and, most of all,
it’s indescribable stench.

224
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,442
A popular supermarket tabloid
has offered a reward of$5,000...

225
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,945
to anyone who brings in
the creature alive.

226
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:22,681
Naturally, we'll have more
on this story as it develops.

227
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:25,250
We now return you to the president's
address already in progress.

228
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:43,435
It looks as if you girls have
been getting along all right,

229
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:46,271
but it's a darn good thing
we found you when we did.

230
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:48,840
There's something horrible
roaming these woods.

231
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,076
There is?

232
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:55,948
Why, that's my husband!

233
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:03,355
His name isn't Bigfoot.
His name is Homer.

234
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,764
- What does it eat?
- I don't understand.
What's this all about?

235
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,467
Well, I suppose pork chops
are his favorite.

236
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:25,044
Get those bears out of here.
I'm tying to do an interview.

237
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:27,046
No bears!
We're taping!

238
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:29,148
All bears off the set.

239
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:35,855
Okay. Now let's get back
to your, uh, husband.

240
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:38,858
How would you describe your
marital relations? Brutish?

241
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:41,660
- Is this going to be on TV?
- Coast to coast.

242
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:46,365
- Just a little further.
- Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

243
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:48,734
- Just a little further.
- Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

244
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:52,471
Food!

245
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:03,849
Nice grizzlies.

246
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:07,119
N-Nice grizzlies.
Nice grizzlies.

247
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,555
- What do we do, Dad?
- Praise the grizzlies, son.

248
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:11,924
Nice grizzlies. Nice grizzlies.

249
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,727
That's a good grizzly.

250
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:17,230
Oh. Oh.

251
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:22,935
- Huh?
- Maggie!

252
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:25,638
Oh, my little girl.

253
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:28,441
Nice grizzlies.
Nice grizzlies.

254
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:32,145
Later, grizzly dudes.

255
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,263
Look! It's him!
It's Bigfoot!

256
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,632
Get in the car!

257
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:54,834
- Get him! Get him!
- Huh?

258
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,237
We got him! We got Bigfoot!

259
00:19:57,337 --> 00:20:00,073
You are darn lucky we got here
in time to rescue you.

260
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:04,344
- What the hell
are you talking about, sir?
- He's getting away. After him!

261
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:07,147
We gotta take him alive.
You got that tranquilizer gun ready?

262
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:19,025
Dad! Oh, Dad!

263
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:23,263
Avenge me, son.
Avenge my death.

264
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:31,271
Last week's capture of Bigfoot
turned into the scientific poser
of the century.

265
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:34,441
Although the creature was ultimately
released, the question remains,

266
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,443
"Who was this Homer?"

267
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:38,445
Was it a man or was it,
in fact,

268
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:40,447
the legendary missing link
known as Bigfoot?

269
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:42,449
Could I have
some applesauce?

270
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,652
Specialists gathered at the
Springfield Primate Institute...

271
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,455
for a firsthand examination
of the controversial creature.

272
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,657
They are now ready
to announce their findings.

273
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:53,160
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

274
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:55,162
uh, distinguished colleagues,

275
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:58,832
after extensive biological
and anatomical testing,

276
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,737
I regret to announce that the evidence
we have is... inconclusive.

277
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:07,241
This thing may or may not be human.

278
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:09,743
That's what he thinks.

279
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:12,913
I say it's none other
than Bigfoot himself.

280
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:15,549
Oh, no.
I disagree. I think it is a man.

281
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,352
The eyes have the glimmer
of human intelligence.

282
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,555
Really. Glimmer in the eyes. What
about the sloping ape-like forehead?

283
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:24,558
Oh, the guys at work
are gonna have a field day with this.

284
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,927
Cheer up, Homer.
At least they let you go.

285
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:30,631
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Fraulein, please.

286
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:33,033
This much I believe
we can agree upon:

287
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:37,238
This specimen is either
a below-average human being...

288
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:39,640
or... a brilliant beast.

289
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,643
Stupid egghead.

290
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:45,312
Oh, Homer.

291
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:47,948
My brilliant beast.

292
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:00,221
Shh!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
