169
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,813
Oh, it hurts to talk.

170
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,981
We'll have to work out
a system of blinks.

171
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,955
Not you, you imbecile.

172
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,189
Oh, P.U., what were
you drinking, gasoline?

173
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:37,668
Yes, I was drinking
gasoline, Mother.

174
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,801
- <i>Uh, Krusty.</i>
- Hang on, kid. I got a tack in my head.

175
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,370
That's one of your posters.
I got all the Krusty stuff.

176
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,850

<i>with my face on it.</i>

177
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:01,383
"Krusty's Personal Swabs"?
What was I thinking?

178
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,758
All these years, I should've
been working on my act...

179
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,263
but I was too busy selling out.

180
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,596
Now I'm just a tired old hack.

[Sobbing]

182
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,873
Ah, that burns!
What the hell is on those things?

183
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,378
- Here. Quick, use my Krusty Eye Wash.
- No, not on your life.

184
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,072
<i>[Bart] Thanks for coming, Jay.</i>
<i>Krusty really needs help.</i>

185
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,083
Oh, no question.

186
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,085
I gotta freshen up my act.

187
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,214
Jay, you're a professional
comedian, right? Right?

188
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,350
- Answer me!
- Yes! Now stop squirming.

189
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,361
I'm trying to get
these tangles out.

190
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,454
They are just impossible.

191
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,298
Well, they are. Anyway,
don't you have some advice for Krusty?

192
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,736
Well, these days, people
like observational humor...

193
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,206
about things they deal with
in everyday life.

194
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,676
Oh, yeah. You mean like when your
lazy butler washes your sock garters...

195
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,679
and they're still
covered with schmutz?

196
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,376
Well, kind of,
but more universal.

197
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,544
And maybe lose
the "me so sorry" bit.

198
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,054
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Let's not tamper with a classic.

199
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,785
Shut up, kid. Come on, Leno.
Tamper, teach, impart.

- Dad!
- Whoops! Sorry, Son.

202
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,460
I didn't know you, Jay Leno and a monkey
were bathing a clown.

203
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,130
Well, they are, so make
with the loofah or get out.

- <i>[Applause]</i>
- And then of course, there's Mom...

205
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,078
who sounds something like this.

"Eat your vegetables.

- Thank you, thank you.

211
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,721

comedy stylings of...

212
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,460
Krusty the Clown!

213
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,796
[Cheers]
Oh, Krusty!

214
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,068
Wait. Where's my water?
Oh, there it is. All right.

215
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,609
Hello.
I'm a real person.

216
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:03,273
And as a real person, I've made some
humorous observations about real life.

217
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,113
For example, have you ever noticed
how there are two phone books...

218
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,779
a white one and a yellow one?

219
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,880
[Chuckles]
Like, what's the deal with that?

220
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,459
One's residential,
the other is business.

221
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,826
Oh, well, that makes sense.

222
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,263
What will they think of next,
blue pages?

223
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,268
They have those.
They're government listings.

224
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,668
I see.

225
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,842
Uh, what about two-cent stamps?

226
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,173
Pizza pie is
very hot these days.

227
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,340
Can't open pickle jars.
No mail on Sunday. Out of paper towels.

228
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:42,148
- Oh, oh, oh. What's the deal with cardboard?
- Boo!

229
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,347
All right, let's just
move on to Notebook 2.

230
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,583
- I've really gotta get dinner started.
- Me too.

231
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,592
I also have to go. Boo!

- Krusty, the acoustics in here-
- I appreciate the effort, kid.

one thing left for me to do.

Why not 20 years ago?

get the word. Krusty's not for sale.

329
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,977
I hope he tells us to burn our pants.
These things are driving me nuts.

330
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,451
So this afternoon,
two suits come up to me...

331
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,046
and ask me to endorse
some new sports utility vehicle.

332
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,388
- What did you do?
- [Gasping]

333
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,862
- Don't you hate pants?
- I threw those two creeps out on their ass.

334
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,762
[Cheering]

335
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,736
Then they followed me home,
beggir me to take a test drive.

336
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,206
And let me tell you,
talk about roomy.

337
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,837
The Canyonero combines the smooth
handling of a European sports car...

338
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,745
with the rugged drivability
of a sturdy 4x4.

339
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,717
- [Murmuring]
- Hey, Krusty, what are you talking about?

340
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,878
I thought you said
those guys were creeps.

341
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,650
Yeah, but that was
before I got to know 'em.

342
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:57,855
And I'm tellir you, the Canyonero
is the Cadillac of automobiles.

343
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,954
That's Canyonero.

344
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,863
[Clamoring]

345
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,362
Wait! Where you going?
I still got plenty of beefs.

346
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,439
Fat-free yogurt.
The-The quality of computer porn.

347
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,141
- [Groans]
- I knew I should've gone on first.

348
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,706
I don't get it, Krusty. You said
you would never be a shill again.

349
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:24,278
[Grunts] I learned something
about myself tonight, kid.

350
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,723
It ain't comedy that's in my blood.
It's selling out.

351
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,761
Come on,
I'll give you a ride home.

352
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,662
Wow. This is roomy.
