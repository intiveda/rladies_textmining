<i>Rresidente,</i> three men are here to see you.

324
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,395
- They claim to have a trillion-dollar bill.
- <i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

325
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,490
Oh, so the island's
not for sale, eh?

326
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:41,369
Well, will you at least permit us
to live in your socialist paradise?

327
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,441
You're talking about Cuba?

328
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:48,445
Exactly. All we ask is preferential treatment
because of my fabulous wealth.

329
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,574
- May I see?
- [Chuckles]
See with your eyes, not with your hands.

330
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,879
Please, we are all amigos here.

331
00:20:54,987 --> 00:21:00,357
Mr. Burns, I think we can trust
the president of Cuba.

332
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,527
- Now give it back.
- Give what back?

333
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,998
Ohh!

334
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,172
It's hard to believe there's a place
worse than America. But we found it.

335
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,235
Yes. I, too, feel a renewed appreciation
for the good old U.S. of A.

336
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:27,080
Oppression and harassment are a small
price to pay to live in the land of the free.

337
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,677
But, uh, sir, aren't you facing
some serious jail time?

338
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:35,317
Well, if it's a crime to love one's country,
then I'm guilty.

339
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,692
And if it's a crime to steal
a trillion dollars from our government...

340
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:43,097
and hand it over to Communist Cuba,
then I'm guilty of that too.

341
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,034
And if it's a crime
to bribe a jury...

342
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,106
then so help me...

343
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,970
I'll soon be guilty of that!

344
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,510
God bless America!

345
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,992
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
