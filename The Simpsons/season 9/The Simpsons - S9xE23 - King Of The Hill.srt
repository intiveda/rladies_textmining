- <i>You too, Marge.</i>

174

If you toned up a little, you'd probably get
a lot more action. [Clicks Tongue]

175
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,600
Homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth.
Food. I mean food.

176
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,608
Sorry. I only eat food in bar form.

177
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,806
When you concentrate food, you unleash
its awesome power, I'm told.

178
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,973
That's why I'm compressing
five pounds of spaghetti...

I got a terrible rash yesterday.

186
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,504
You know Rainier Wolfcastle?

187
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,904
Yeah. He helped me blast through

I thought you'd be here
pumping those guns.

191
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,244
We've come up with a killer promotion
for Powersauce bars.

192
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,979
- Picture this. You-
- I love it.

193
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:59,114
- climb the highest mountain in Springfield.
- <i>The Murderhorn.</i>

That's suicide.

[Scoffs]
Sure! For experienced mountain climbers.

196
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,433
But you're a movie star.
And you'll have the Powersauce edge.

197
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,970
Not for all the applesauce
in Glückenschlabel.

198
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:19,109
My dad could do it. He eats 50 dollars' won'th
of Powersauce bars a day.

199
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,146
Overshoot the extreme.
Max the envelope and so on.

200
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,739
Wow. He's really been paying attention
to our slogans.

New angle: Joe Schlub eats Powersauce bar,
becomes world's mightiest man.

203
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,582
It's believable.
That's what I like about it.

- Congratulations, sir.
- Huh?

205
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,095
You're gonna be the first man
to climb the Murderhorn.

Wait a minute.

339
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,279
I'm on the top.
I actually did it!

340
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,649
I climbed the unclimbable mountain!

341
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:28,249
Bow down before me, everyone,
for I am your king!

342
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,588
Family to Dad.
Family to Dad.

343
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,896
- Come in, Dad.
- Uh, I'm pretty sure he's dead, little girl.

344
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,869
Here. Have a Powersauce bar.
It's on the house.

345
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,270
Hey. Something's comir down
the mountain- fast!

346
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,400
<i>Oh, no! He fell!</i>
<i>I can't look!</i>

347
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,138
[Faint Shouting]

348
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,887
- Hi.
- Oh, Homie! You're alive!

349
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,255
Oh, Marge.
I never thought you'd see me again.

350
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,329
Where in the world
did you find a sled on top of the-

351
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,329
[Screams]

352
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,958
- [All Gasping]
- We're too late. He's dead.

353
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,261
It looks like
someone tried to eat him.

354
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,339
What are you looking at me for?

355
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,638
You're all crazy.
Crazy as a-

356
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,281
Okay. Here's what I think happened.

357
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,018
Did you make it
to the top, Dad? Huh? Did ya?

358
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,956
Why don't you tell me, Son?

359
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,755
See any interesting flags up there?

360
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,763
<i>All I see is a pole.</i>
<i>Maybe the flag fell off.</i>

361
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,833
Ah, damn it!

362
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,493
Forget about it, Homer.
You made it to the top.

363
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,628
<i>You're the coolest dad ever.</i>

364
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,367
Thanks, Bart.
That makes it all won'thwhile.

365
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,002
