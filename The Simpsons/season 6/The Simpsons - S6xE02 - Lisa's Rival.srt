1
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,840
Lisa, will you keep it down?

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,120
I'm making a crank call
to Principal Skinner.

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,640
As a matter of fact,
my refrigerator wasn't running.

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,040
You spared me quite a bit of spoilage.
Thank you, anonymous young man.

5
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,880
It's my room and I can
do what I want.

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,720
Oh, yeah? Well, I can do
what I want in my room.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,920
Bart, quit it!

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,880
I can keep this up all day.

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,200
Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying
to fix your mother's camera.

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,080
Easy. Easy.

11
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,040
I'm gonna need a bigger drill.

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,760
My, these seas are certainly heaving.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,440
Well, no more than your
bountiful bosom, my lady.

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
Does that earring
mean you're a pirate?

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,840
Kind of.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
The seas have quieted.

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,800
And only in the sweet embrace
of quietude can two lovers truly be as...

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,120
Such noise! Well, I'm done
for the evening.

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,760
Lisa, stop blowing my sex. I mean, stop
blowing your sax. Your sax. Stop it.

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,480
Mom, I'm auditioning for first chair
in the school band...

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000
...and I've got to practice.

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,520
I'm sorry, but I sacrificed
a very expensive camera...

23
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,360
...just to get some quiet time.

24
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,880
Fine, I'll play outside.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,200
Hey! Why, that sounds
like Gabriel's trumpet.

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,760
You know what that means, kids.

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,480
Judgment Day!

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,000
Forty-five seconds till pencils down.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,760
Lisa, what's the answer
to number seven?

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,400
Sorry, Ralph. That would defeat
the purpose of testing...

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,600
...as a means of student evaluation.

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,440
My cat's name is Mittens.

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,320
Three. Two. One.
And that's pencils down.

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,240
Now, here's an oral
extra-credit question.

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,680
What was Christopher Columbus
actually looking for...

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,040
...when he discovered America?

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Anyone besides Lisa for a change?

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,760
Ralph, this better not be
about your cat.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,640
- Oh, all right.
- He was looking for a passage to India.

40
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,440
Correct, Allison. And on your
very first day in our class.

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
And during a subsequent voyage,
Columbus found...

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,480
...the continent of South America.

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,000
I never made Miss Hoover "yow-wee."

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,800
Hi, Allison. I'm Lisa Simpson.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
It's great to finally meet someone
who converses...

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,280
...above the normal 8-year-old level.

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,720
Actually, I'm 7.

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,760
I was skipped ahead because
I was bored in the first grade.

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,320
You're younger than me too?

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,360
- Are you hyperventilating?
- No. I just like to smell my lunch.

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,720
I never met anyone
who skipped a grade before.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,480
I'm surprised you haven't.
You're obviously smart enough.

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,920
Well, I'm sure I could have.

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,920
But I'd hate to leave behind
all my wonderful friends.

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,760
Out of the way, brain queen!

56
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,760
Hey, Sara.

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,400
Well, I gotta go. I have to practice
for band auditions.

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
Me too. What instrument do you play?

59
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,040
- The sax.
- Me too.

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,360
- I'm going for first chair this year.
- Me too.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,000
Wow! We have so much in common.
I'm sure we'll be the best of friends.

62
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,560
- Me too.
- Me too.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,880
Hurry up and finish eating.

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,680
You're steering fine, boy.

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,360
Hard to the right. Hard to the left.
Cat! Deer! Old man!

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
Jackknifed sugar truck!

67
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,760
Sugar?

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,640
Don't worry. Here's a quarter.

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Call for help. I'll keep an eye
on things here.

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,640
If only the sugar were
as sweet as you, sir.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
That was downright decent of you.

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,200
We hit the jackpot here!

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,400
White gold! Texas tea!

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,000
Sweetener.

75
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,800
Dad, isn't this stealing?

76
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,440
Read your town charter, boy.
If foodstuff should touch the ground...

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,320
...said foodstuff shall be turned over
to the village idiot.

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Since I don't see him around,
start shoveling!

79
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
- Mom?
- What? What?

80
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,040
Why am I rotting away in the second
grade instead of being skipped ahead?

81
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,120
I don't know. I guess that's
the school's decision to make.

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Did you talk to anyone at school?
Make a few calls on my behalf?

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,720
You could've been nicer to Principal
Skinner, if you know what I mean.

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,600
Lisa! I am nice.

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Homer, I appreciate you making dinner,
but this food tastes a little strange.

86
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,440
It hurts my teeth.

87
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,880
That's because I've loaded it
with sugar!

88
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Marge, our ship has come in.

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,720
I found 500 pounds of sugar
in the forest...

90
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,960
...that I'm gonna sell directly
to the consumer.

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,680
And all for a low, low price
of one dollar per pound.

92
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,080
But the store sells sugar
for 35 cents a pound.

93
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,360
And it doesn't have nails
and broken glass in it.

94
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,800
Those are prizes.

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,800
A blasting cap.

96
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
It's your turn, Jimbo.

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,200
Someone's been practicing
over the summer. Welcome aboard.

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,160
Yes!

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
My lute!

100
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,880
Lisa Simpson trying
for first-chair saxophone.

101
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,720
Very nice. Now Allison Taylor,
also trying for first-chair saxophone.

102
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,760
This is a very tough decision, girls.
You're both very good.

103
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,040
Well, I guess that clinches it.

104
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,040
That was a close one, Lisa,
but you made it.

105
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,480
I won first chair?

106
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,080
No, you regained consciousness.
Allison got first chair.

107
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,840
Oh, it was just a dream.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
That was a close one, Lisa,
but you made it.

109
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,760
I won first chair?

110
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,400
No, you regained consciousness.
Allison got first chair.

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,440
And believe me, this is not a dream!

112
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,880
I need help. There's another girl
at school...

113
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,600
...who's smarter, younger
and a better sax player than me.

114
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,640
- I feel so average.
- You'll always be number one to me.

115
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,920
Hello! First born within earshot.

116
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
I meant my number one girl.

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,560
Oh, for crying...

118
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,000
Honey, if you get too competitive,
you'll never be happy.

119
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,720
No matter how good you are,
there's always someone better.

120
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,400
I thought I had the tallest hair, but that
trip to Graceland really opened my eyes.

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,280
But she's better than me at
everything that makes me special.

122
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,520
Believe me, honey. She's more scared
of you than you are of her.

123
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,040
You're thinking of bears, Mom.

124
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,980
Hey, Allison, what's the answer
to number nine?

125
00:08:07,146 --> 00:08:10,692
- I can't tell you, Ralph.
- I can't tell you either, Ralph.

126
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,736
Leave me alone.

127
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:14,530
- Brainiac!
- Nerd!

128
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:15,990
You're such a geekazoid!

129
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:17,950
Leave me alone.

130
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:22,539
That used to be my face in the mud.

131
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:25,500
I can't stand to see you
so miserable, Lis.

132
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,795
Unless it's from a rubber
spider down your dress.

133
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:29,463
That gives me an idea.

134
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,843
Note for later: Put rubber spider
down Lisa's dress.

135
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,605
Hey, I know! How about if I dig up
some dirt on Allison?

136
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,442
Remember how I got Milhouse
on America 's Most Wanted?

137
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,822
- There he is on the monkey bars.
- Try to take him alive.

138
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,491
Oh, no! Not again!

139
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,623
I appreciate the offer, but it goes against
every moral fiber in my body.

140
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,335
Suit yourself. If you change your mind,
here's my card.

141
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,629
Don't need it.
You live in the room next to me.

142
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,716
Note: Next year, order fewer cards.

143
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,718
And you didn't think
I'd make any money.

144
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,554
I found a dollar while I was
waiting for the bus.

145
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,682
While you were out "earning"
that dollar...

146
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,268
...you lost 40 dollars
by not going to work.

147
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:21,730
The plant said if you don't come
tomorrow, don't bother coming Monday.

148
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,607
Four-day weekend!

149
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:31,408
Hey, I am above average.

150
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:36,038
So what if Allison's ahead of me?
There's no shame in being second.

151
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:38,875
And now Avis Rent A Car
is proud to present...

152
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,669
...the second-best band in America.

153
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:45,090
We welcome Garfunkel, Messina,
Oates and Lisa...

154
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,261
...singing their number two hit,
"Born to Runner-Up."

155
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,103
Why would they come
to our concert to boo us?

156
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,273
Lis, I did some checking
on this Allison.

157
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:01,692
And I know it's against
all your moral fibers...

158
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,486
Give it to me!

159
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:05,822
Hey, wait. There's nothing bad here.

160
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,991
Yep. She's clean as a bean.

161
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,826
But I did tip off the feds...

162
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:13,497
...as to the whereabouts
of our good friend Milhouse.

163
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:17,043
- But I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.
- I don't care.

164
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,470
My glasses!

165
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:31,684
I've got to stop being so petty.

166
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:34,270
I should be Allison's friend,
not her competitor.

167
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:39,193
I mean, she is a wonderful person.

168
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:42,071
Way to go, Lis. I mean,
why compete with someone...

169
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:44,365
...who's just gonna kick
your butt anyway.

170
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,284
I prefer my phrasing.

171
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,665
It's great of you to come over.
I really want us to be friends.

172
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:53,834
You're a wonderful person.

173
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:56,462
Hi, Lisa. I'm Allison's father,
Professor Taylor.

174
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,841
- I've heard great things about you.
- Oh, really? I...

175
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:03,094
I'm glad we have someone who can
join us in our anagram games.

176
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:07,266
We take names and rearrange the letters
to form a description of that person.

177
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:10,353
Well, like, oh, I don't know...
Alec Guinness.

178
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,232
- Genuine class.
- Very good.

179
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,276
All right, Lisa.

180
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:19,112
Jeremy Irons.

181
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:23,409
Jeremy's Iron.

182
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:29,624
Well, that's very good for a first try.

183
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,419
You know, I have a ball.

184
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:34,546
Perhaps you'd like to bounce it.

185
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:44,808
- What's this?
- It's for the school diorama competition.

186
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:47,895
You're finished already?
But the competition isn't for weeks!

187
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:50,773
Lisa, we're talking dioramas.
Who could wait?

188
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,443
I chose "The Tell-Tale Heart"
by Edgar Allan Poe.

189
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,571
See, this is the bedroom
where the old man was murdered.

190
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:59,575
And he's buried here
under the floorboards.

191
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,828
And, look, I used an old metronome
to simulate the heartbeat...

192
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:06,124
...that drove the killer insane.

193
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,212
Neat, huh?

194
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:13,632
It's great. It's really great.

195
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,183
Got away from you, huh?
Well, you keep at it.

196
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:31,507
Must protect sugar.

197
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:36,137
Thieves everywhere.
The strong must protect the sweet.

198
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,515
The sweet.

199
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,645
- Homer?
- In America...

200
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,189
...first you get the sugar...

201
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,483
...then you get the power...

202
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:50,362
...then you get the women.

203
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,030
Homer.

204
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:53,740
- Homer!
- What?

205
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:56,035
Forget about guarding
the stupid sugar.

206
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,037
You're being completely paranoid.

207
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:01,541
Oh, am I? Am I really?

208
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,710
Hello.

209
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:06,004
Where'd you get your
sugar for that tea?

210
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:09,759
I nipped it when you let your
guard down for that split second.

211
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:11,886
And I'd do it again.

212
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,973
- Goodbye.
- You see, Marge? You see?

213
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,684
When are you gonna give up
this crazy sugar scheme?

214
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:19,978
Never! Never, Marge.

215
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:22,690
I can't live the button-down life
like you.

216
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:26,235
I want it all. The terrifying lows,
the dizzying highs...

217
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:27,820
...the creamy middles.

218
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:30,991
Sure, I might offend a few
of the blue noses...

219
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:33,410
...with my cocky stride
and musky odors.

220
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:37,623
Oh, I'll never be the darling
of the so-called city fathers...

221
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,293
...who cluck their tongues,
stroke their beards...

222
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,089
...and talk about, "What's to be done
with this Homer Simpson?"

223
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,925
Look. Just get rid of the sugar, okay?

224
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,427
No!

225
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:57,896
Hey, get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!

226
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,693
Oh, they're defending
themselves somehow.

227
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,406
Look, Bart. It almost killed me...

228
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:10,243
...but I handcrafted all 75 characters
from Oliver Twist.

229
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,704
And now the coup de grâce:

230
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:16,208
A bitter snowstorm.

231
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,551
- Is it okay?
- Well...

232
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,513
The important thing
is that we survived.

233
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,185
Who am I kidding? There's no way
I'm ever gonna beat Allison!

234
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,312
Sure there is.

235
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:39,902
But it involves being a bit underhanded.
A bit devious, a bit...

236
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:42,780
...as the French say, "Bart-esque."

237
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,407
I'll do whatever it takes.

238
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:47,869
Then welcome to the nether regions
of the soul.

239
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,082
Now, here's what we do.

240
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:54,209
Tomorrow, when Allison comes out...

241
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:58,464
...we spray her with the hose,
soaking her from head to toe.

242
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,550
- Leaving us relatively dry.
- Relatively?

243
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,510
There's bound to be some splashback.

244
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:05,889
Bart, her being wet won't help me
win the competition!

245
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:08,017
Well, we could just sabotage
her diorama...

246
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:10,770
...humiliating her in front of
the students and faculty.

247
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:12,438
- Perfect!
- Leaving her primed...

248
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,316
...for the most dramatic
hose-soaking of her life!

249
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:17,235
Enough with the hose!

250
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,032
Well, sure is quiet in here today.

251
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,536
Yes, a little too quiet
if you know what I mean.

252
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:27,622
- I'm afraid I don't.
- You see...

253
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:31,418
...bees usually make
a lot of noise. No noise...

254
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:33,295
...suggests no bees.

255
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:36,674
I understand now.
Oh, look. There goes one.

256
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:39,302
- To the Beemobile!
- You mean your Chevy?

257
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:40,845
Yes.

258
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:42,889
Very clever, Simpson.

259
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:44,516
Luring our bees to your sugar...

260
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:46,894
...and selling them back
at an inflated price.

261
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:50,856
- Bees are on the what, now?
- Simpson, you diabolical...

262
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:54,319
We're willing to pay you $2000
for the swarm.

263
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,862
Deal!

264
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,242
Oh, wait a minute.
The bees are leaving.

265
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,289
No! My sugar is melting!

266
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:07,959
Melting! Oh, what a world!

267
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,675
I'm sorry, Homie.

268
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:17,762
It's okay, Marge.
I've learned my lesson.

269
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,057
A mountain of sugar
is too much for one man.

270
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:24,936
It's clear now why God portions it out
in those tiny packets...

271
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,315
...and why he lives
on a plantation in Hawaii.

272
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:34,197
Diorama-Rama. My favorite school event
next to Hearing Test Thursday.

273
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:36,449
"The Grapes of Wrath"? I don't get it.

274
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:40,537
Here's the grapes,
and here's the wrath!

275
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,709
Yes, yes. Very good wrath.

276
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:48,296
Let's see. Our foreign exchange
student, Uter, has chosen...

277
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:50,674
...Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

278
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:52,092
I...

279
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,969
But this is just an empty box.

280
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:58,432
I begged you to look at mine first.
I begged you!

281
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:03,813
Lisa, here is, as the French say,
"Le fake diorama."

282
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,067
I'll create a diversion
and you make the switch.

283
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,529
Hey, everybody! Whoa!
Look at me! I'm over here!

284
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,615
Turn this way right now!

285
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:16,244
- Hey, it's Bart!
- And he's doing stuff!

286
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:20,290
- Oh, I can't take my eyes off him.
- Look what he's doing.

287
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,503
Bart, stop creating a diversion
and get out of here!

288
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:32,721
Our next entry is "The Tell-Tale Heart"
from Allison Taylor.

289
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:34,890
I can't wait. Be ready with the ribbon.

290
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:41,272
- What is it?
- It's a cow's heart.

291
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:44,276
Them trying to make a monkey
out of you.

292
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:47,946
Allison, is this supposed to be
some kind of joke?

293
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:50,950
I didn't do that.

294
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,368
I made a different one.

295
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:55,955
Oh, is that so, young lady?
Well, where is this phantom diorama?

296
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,750
I don't know.

297
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:06,801
Have the guts to take the blame, girl.

298
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:09,930
- You're compounding your folly by lying.
- Right on!

299
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:12,975
Young lady, cow hearts belong
in a butcher's window...

300
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:16,729
...not the classroom. Well, maybe
in an older student's biology classroom...

301
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,358
...but that's none of my business.
Elementary school is where I wound up...

302
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,736
...and it's too late to do
anything about that.

303
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:26,865
Frankly, I'm starting to regret
skipping you ahead.

304
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:42,758
It's the beating of that hideous heart!

305
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:46,012
I mean, I think I hear something.

306
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:53,061
Why, here's Allison's real diorama.
It got misplaced, or so it would seem.

307
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:56,649
Oh, well, that changes everything.
Let's have a look. Get the ribbon ready.

308
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:01,488
Little sterile.

309
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:03,490
No real insight.

310
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,492
What do you think, Miss Hoover?

311
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:09,580
This has been
a very disappointing day.

312
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,457
All right, on to Lisa Simpson.

313
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,959
You're a shoo-in now, Lis.

314
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:15,587
After the way I've behaved,
I don't deserve to win.

315
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:18,048
- Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
- What?

316
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,802
Now we're into the dregs.
Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry.

317
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:25,348
Prepackaged Star Wars characters
still in their display box?

318
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:27,225
Are those limited edition figures?

319
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,768
What's a diorama?

320
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,645
Why, it's Luke and Obi-Wan.

321
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,440
And my favorite, Chewie.
They're all here!

322
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,192
- What do you think?
- It's lunchtime.

323
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,819
We have a winner!

324
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:45,704
I'm really sorry about
what I did, Allison.

325
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,123
It's no shame being second to you.

326
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:49,542
Thank you, Lisa.

327
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,086
You know, I'm actually
kind of glad I lost.

328
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:55,340
Now I know that losing
isn't the end of the world.

329
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:57,592
Hey, you still think we can be friends?

330
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,636
Only if we're the best.

331
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:03,557
I beat the smart kids,
I beat the smart ki...

332
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:05,601
I bent my Wookiee.

333
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,605
Hey, Ralph. Want to come with me
and Allison to play anagrams?

334
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,609
We take names and rearrange the letters
to form a description of that person.

335
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:15,279
My cat's breath smells like cat food.
