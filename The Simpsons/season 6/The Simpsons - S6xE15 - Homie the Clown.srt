1
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:05,987
Homie the Clown

2
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,356
When Krusty wants to,
he can still blow them away.

3
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:54,644
Yes. He can take a simple,
everyday thing like eating a bicycle...

4
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:55,919
...and make it funny.

5
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:57,564
See you tomorrow, kids.

6
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:02,396
But before I go, I'd just like to say...

7
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:13,034
There's nothing better
than a cigarette...

8
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,651
...unless it's a cigarette
lit with a $ 100 bill.

9
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:20,248
Put 5000 bucks on the Lakers. Hire
Kenny G to play for me in the elevator.

10
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,732
My house is dirty. Buy me a clean one.

11
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,980
Krusty, as your accountant,
I must warn you...

12
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:26,389
Did you send 1000 roses...

13
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:28,570
...to Bea Arthur's grave?
- Yes. But she's...

14
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:30,550
I don't wanna hear
the end of sentences.

15
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:31,792
George Carlin on three.

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,644
Yeah. Lawsuit? Oh, come on.

17
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,792
My "Seven Words
You Can't Say on TV" bit...

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,215
...was entirely different from your bit.

19
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:45,517
So I'm a thief, am I?
Well, excuse me!

20
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:47,899
- Give him 10 grand.
- Steve Martin on four.

21
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,678
Ten grand.

22
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:54,309
Krusty, in regards to the large wager
you made on yesterday's horse race...

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,000
Come on. How about letting me go
double or nothing on the opera tonight.

24
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,711
- Who do you like?
- The tenor.

25
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:03,168
Okay. But we're only
letting the bet ride...

26
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:06,993
...because you crack us
so consistently up.

27
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:10,315
You've got to stop blowing
your money like this, Krusty.

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,960
No can do.

29
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,819
And those ridiculous bets you make.

30
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:19,342
Gambling is the finest thing
a person can do if he's good at it.

31
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:22,664
- You haven't won anything in months.
- So I'll just make more money.

32
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:26,054
- Crank out some merchandise.
- You already merchandised everything.

33
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,544
Krusty's Monopoly game,
the Krusty Crowd-Control Barrier.

34
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:32,732
Nothing is selling anymore.
Not even your new Lady Krusty line.

35
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:35,550
But our infomercials are running
24 hours a day.

36
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:40,785
So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty
Mustache-Removal System, Angelique?

37
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,470
It's Krusterrific, Johnny Unitas.

38
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:46,255
But is my upper lip
supposed to bleed like this?

39
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:47,497
Probably.

40
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:50,886
At this rate, you'll be broke in a month.
Only thing left to do is...

41
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:53,772
...to open a clown college
and train some regional Krustys.

42
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,154
You mean like that bozo,
Bonko the Clown?

43
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:57,933
- Exactly.
- Forget it.

44
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:00,416
I'll just cut back
on the condor-egg omelets.

45
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,235
A couple of those
would be tasty right now.

46
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:04,980
I'll found the college tomorrow.

47
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,013
It must be the first of the month.
New Billboard Day!

48
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:23,235
Finders, keepers.

49
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,369
"This year, give her English muffins."

50
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:30,550
Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard.

51
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:36,960
"Best in the West."

52
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,577
That rhymes.

53
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:45,685
Clown college. You can't eat that.

54
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:49,577
I got everything
I was supposed to get.

55
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:52,295
I'm not going to enroll
in that clown college, though.

56
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:56,087
That advertisement had
no effect on me whatsoever.

57
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,215
Hey, Homer. The section you're
supposed to be monitoring is on fire.

58
00:04:19,913 --> 00:04:21,725
Clowns are funny.

59
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:35,409
- Mom?
- I think I'll have some wine.

60
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:44,134
- Marge?
- Yes, Homie.

61
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,631
That's it. You people have
stood in my way long enough.

62
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,745
I'm going to clown college.

63
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,309
I don't think any of us
expected him to say that.

64
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:02,319
All right. Now, there can only be
one Krusty in each territory.

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,708
So I hope this works out.
Tell me where you're from.

66
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:07,185
- Georgia.
- Texas.

67
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:09,970
- Brooklyn.
- Russia.

68
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,916
- New Hampshire.
- Homer.

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,372
Okay, we'll start off with the baggy p...
Wha...?

70
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:18,258
Those are supposed to be
baggy pants. Baggy!

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,460
I've never had a pair of pants
that fit this well in my life.

72
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:26,849
Okay. Memorize these
funny place names:

73
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,279
Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga...

74
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,124
...Seattle.

75
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,446
Stop it. You're killing me.

76
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:39,500
Seattle.

77
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:48,829
And now, everybody's favorite,
the Spin-Cycle Fantastic trick.

78
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,446
It's a great piece of buffoonery
if you pull it off.

79
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:54,534
But if you blow it,
you'll look like a fool.

80
00:05:57,386 --> 00:05:59,735
Steady. Steady.

81
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:06,044
Now, when the wealthy dowager
comes in, the party's over, right?

82
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:07,487
Wrong.

83
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:10,977
"Kill wealthy dowager."

84
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:19,768
Burn that seat.

85
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,386
These Krusty-brand balloons
are 3 bucks each.

86
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:25,372
Get a cheap one, and what happens?
Goes off!

87
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,265
Takes out the eyeballs of every kid in
the room. What's that gonna cost you?

88
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,044
Hey, Bill. What did that cost us?

89
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,970
I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad.

90
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:58,393
If there has to be a bastardized version
of Krusty, I'm glad it's you.

91
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:00,406
Thanks, honey. Bank shot!

92
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,668
- That's good aim, Dad.
- Well, it was my major.

93
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:09,393
Welcome to the noble family
of skilled Krustaceans.

94
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:14,326
You'll now go back to your hometowns
and do kids' parties, swap meets...

95
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:18,789
...and the other piddling crap I wouldn't
touch with a 10-foot clown pole.

96
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,272
Now come and get your catskins...

97
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,883
I mean, sheepskins.

98
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,970
This is the happiest day of my life...

99
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:34,963
Got it. No shock for me.

100
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,312
Oh, yeah?

101
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:51,887
And now, to help introduce our fantastic
new burger, the one with ketchup...

102
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,988
...here he is, coming in by parachute,
Krusty the Clown.

103
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:20,478
"To audience. I now proclaim
this new burger for sale."

104
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,089
Lord, save me.

105
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,894
It's the Krusty Burglar.

106
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,679
Oh, my God.
He's stealing all the burgers.

107
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:42,827
Why, you little...

108
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:48,431
Homer. Homer, it's all just an act.

109
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:50,847
Stop. Stop.

110
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,995
He's already dead.

111
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,975
- Sir. Sir.
- I gotta get him.

112
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:56,417
Get him.

113
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:59,370
Krusty the Clown, everybody.

114
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:04,740
Please look at my
MedicAlert bracelet.

115
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:17,659
Hey, hey.

116
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:22,894
And then take that and...

117
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:24,975
...put that in there and...

118
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,800
...here's your giraffe, little girl.
- I'm a boy.

119
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,417
That's the spirit. Never give up.

120
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:34,203
Well, I guess you're pretty
impressed, huh, Bart?

121
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,397
My dad got Krusty the Clown
to personally appear at my party.

122
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:41,082
I have a feeling I could get him
to appear at my house.

123
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:46,115
I don't know, Bart. My dad's a pretty
big wheel down at the cracker factory.

124
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,686
It's not 5:30 yet.

125
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:09,068
- Hey, nice threads.
- I'm beat.

126
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:13,599
And after work, I gotta dedicate a new
Jiffy Lube and cohost the ACE Awards.

127
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,089
- Wow, Jiffy Lube.
- Boy, you're running yourself ragged.

128
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,458
Yeah. When I started this clown thing,
I thought it would be nothing but glory.

129
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,277
You know,
the glory of being a clown.

130
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:28,800
I tell you, it's hard, tiring work.

131
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,525
But when I see the smiles
on their little faces...

132
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:35,981
...I just know they're getting ready
to jab me with something.

133
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:43,126
Well, my time's almost up here.
So I'd like to say I know Woody Allen.

134
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:50,240
And now, the winner for the most
promising new series on cable:

135
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,193
Old Starsky and Hutch's.

136
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:57,689
Accepting the award is the son
of the guy who played Huggy Bear.

137
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:06,347
Let's walk and talk. I have wonderful
stories about other famous people...

138
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:09,904
...that include me in some way.
- Can't. Gotta distract bulls at a rodeo.

139
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:11,716
Hey, me too. We can go together.

140
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,568
No. I'm going a different way
than you, Dick.

141
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,696
Your churlish attitude reminds me of the
time I had dinner with Groucho and...

142
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,038
You're gonna have dinner with
Groucho tonight if you don't beat it.

143
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:29,703
Being a clown sucks. Kicked by kids,
bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly.

144
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:32,958
Who am I clowning?
I have no business being a clown.

145
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:36,783
I'm leaving the clowning business to the
other clowns in the clowning business.

146
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:38,897
Oh, no.

147
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,582
Well, well, well, velocity boy.

148
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,864
I'm gonna give you
the biggest ticket you...

149
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:45,575
Hey, Krusty!

150
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:48,730
- I'm not Krusty.
- To think I was gonna give you a ticket.

151
00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:50,978
- Krusty the Clown.
- I am not Krusty.

152
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,964
Hey, Krusty, Krusty. You remember
the time we got loaded...

153
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:56,884
...and set those beavers loose
in that pine-furniture store?

154
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:01,683
Memories.
All right, you take it easy, Krusty.

155
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,347
Hey, he didn't give me a ticket.

156
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:09,300
This is an intriguing development.

157
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:13,193
You mean I get 5 percent off everything
in the store just because I look like...

158
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,179
I mean, just because I am
Krusty the Clown?

159
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:19,837
How could I charge full price to the man
whose lust for filthy magazines...

160
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,421
...kept me in business during
that first shaky year?

161
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,911
Oh, by the way, here is your
new issue of Gigantic Asses.

162
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,770
I'm telling you, this'll work. They'll
think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff.

163
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:33,763
I've been getting free stuff all day.
Look at this swell bucket of house paint.

164
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:35,978
- Look at it.
- I'm not saying it won't work.

165
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:40,005
- I'm just saying it's dishonest.
- If we agree, then why are we arguing?

166
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:45,810
Hey, Krusty, hey.
Beautiful date tonight, huh?

167
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:48,394
And such lovely children
you have now.

168
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:52,320
- I'm more striking than lovely.
- You come with me. Come with Luigi.

169
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,340
You don't want to sit
with the rest of the scum.

170
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,783
- Hey.
- What's going on?

171
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:01,742
I only consider you scum
compared to Krusty.

172
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:04,661
- Well, I can see that.
- Yeah, you see how you scum.

173
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:12,513
Let me get this straight. You took
money made franchising your name...

174
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:14,795
...and bet it against
the Harlem Globetrotters?

175
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:17,614
Oh, I thought the Generals were due.

176
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:24,728
He's spinning the ball on his finger.
Just take it. Take the ball.

177
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:30,634
That game was fixed. They were using
a freaking ladder, for God's sake.

178
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:35,399
I am afraid the time
has come for you to pay us.

179
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,218
Look, I'm cleaned out.
Just take the clown college.

180
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,862
We have already taken it.

181
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:41,876
Kids have a lot of money these days.

182
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:45,668
So after you finish your performance,
you might consider robbing them.

183
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:48,520
What can I tell you?
You can't get blood from a turnip.

184
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:51,641
You wanna kill me,
go ahead and kill me.

185
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:54,158
Hey, all right, okay already.

186
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:57,279
- Look, we can talk this over.
- No more talk.

187
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,433
It is time for us
to take you for a ride.

188
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,111
Oh, no...

189
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:06,373
- Mind if I go to the bathroom first?
- I see no harm in that.

190
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,453
When he's done in there, I gotta go.

191
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:23,833
Okay, wherever Krusty's gone,
we'll find him.

192
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:27,658
Legs, you check out the East Side.
Louie, Rome and Budapest.

193
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,746
Tell the boys
I want a total world search.

194
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,222
- Right, boss.
- Right, boss.

195
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:38,598
I want a free car because I'm Krusty.
Krusty the Clown. Get it? Krusty.

196
00:14:41,182 --> 00:14:43,095
Cancel the world search.

197
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:48,967
I want everything that's coming to
Krusty the Clown, which is me, Krusty.

198
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,819
Hey, it's Krusty, all right.

199
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:55,242
Should I shoot him
gangland-style or execution-style?

200
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,457
Listen to your heart.

201
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:00,041
Well, I can't
give you the car, Krusty.

202
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:04,538
But I can let you have this little number
for practically nothing. Only $38,000.

203
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:07,726
Hey, what are all these holes?

204
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:09,739
Speed holes.
They make the car go faster.

205
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:12,491
Oh, yeah. Speed holes.

206
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:17,994
You want my advice?
I think you should buy this car.

207
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,249
We need more ammo.
Let's go to Big 5.

208
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:27,726
Krusty, your plastic surgery is complete.
Now, when I remove the bandages...

209
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,115
...don't be alarmed by the total stranger
staring back at you.

210
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:37,122
I look exactly the same,
you moron!

211
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:40,075
Oh, nonsense, Krusty.
You look at least 10 years younger.

212
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:43,598
- Plus, I did your breasts.
- Hear me complaining about the breasts?

213
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,611
Oh, what's the use in hiding?

214
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,195
I gotta go back to Springfield
and face the music.

215
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:49,806
Can you loan me bus fare?

216
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:51,853
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

217
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,430
What you diddily doing, neighbor?

218
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:01,685
I'm putting speed holes
in my car. Makes it go faster.

219
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:05,309
Is that so? Well, gee, maybe the old
Flanders-mobile could use...

220
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:12,116
Wow, lucky I always keep a Bible
close to my heart...

221
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:19,801
Lucky I was wearing this extra-large
piece of the true cross today.

222
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:21,747
I think I'll go inside.

223
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:25,438
What keeps doing that?

224
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,297
I told you we should've bought more
than three bullets. Let's just grab him.

225
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:31,109
Hey!

226
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,109
But wait. You can't kill me
for being Krusty. I'm not him.

227
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,693
- I'm Homer Simpson.
- The same Homer Simpson who...

228
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:41,109
...crashed his car through the wall
of our club?

229
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:43,995
Actually, my name is Barney.
Yeah, Barney Gumble.

230
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:47,385
The same Barney Gumble
who keeps taking pictures of my sister?

231
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:49,264
Actually, my real name is...

232
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:51,579
Think, Krusty, think. Joe Valachi.

233
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:55,405
Same Joe Valachi who squealed to the
Senate committee about organized crime?

234
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:57,687
- Benedict Arnold.
- The same Benedict Arnold...

235
00:16:57,854 --> 00:17:00,640
...who plotted to surrender
West Point to the hated British?

236
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:07,720
I am so glad I had
a chance to meet you...

237
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:12,385
...before we did this, Krusty,
because I am a great fan.

238
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:14,968
Don Vittorio Dimaggio.

239
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:16,781
Krusty the Clown.

240
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:19,801
Sorry I have to do this, Krusty.

241
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:24,700
I cannot do it.

242
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:29,834
To murder a funnyman
of such genius would be a crime.

243
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,217
Tell you what, Krusty.

244
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,713
Do for me my favorite trick, where you
ride the little bike through the loop...

245
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:40,438
...and I will let you live.
- But I've never been able to do the...

246
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:44,096
Hey, how about if I squirt you
in the face with my boutonnière? Okay.

247
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:49,398
- I'll never be able to do
this trick. Never. - Go. Go.

248
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,767
Hey. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

249
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:57,250
I'm the greatest clown in the world.

250
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:11,378
The fact that you did not do the trick
well is the biggest insult of all.

251
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,425
Hey, guys. I came to...

252
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:17,989
Oh, you got a deadly game of
cat and mouse going. I'll come back.

253
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,781
I'm seeing double here.
Four Krustys.

254
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:26,613
Krusty. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
You came here to save me.

255
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,230
Yeah. That's what I did.

256
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:34,364
My apologies to you. I almost
made a grievous error.

257
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:37,083
- Goodbye, Krusty.
- Wait.

258
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,908
He can't kill anybody if he doesn't
know which one's the real Krusty.

259
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,177
I am confused.

260
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:50,002
- Good one, Krusty.
- Oh, crap.

261
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:52,989
Because of that
disrespectful display...

262
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:55,270
...I shall now kill both of you.

263
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,908
Unless you both go
through the loop together.

264
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:12,922
I can't see, you idiot.
Take your hands off my eyes.

265
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:32,183
- Hey.
- Not bad.

266
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,465
Without the loop, it is nothing.

267
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:51,579
Yeah, Krustys!

268
00:19:54,289 --> 00:20:00,027
Grazie. Grazie. You have brought
great joy to this old Italian stereotype.

269
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:03,987
- No, no, Don Vittorio. You're not...
- Yes, I am. I know it. I am.

270
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:07,812
- Anyway, thank you, Krusty.
- Oh, you're welcome.

271
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:11,738
- So we're even now, huh?
- No, we just won't kill you.

272
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,852
But you still owe us the money.

273
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:17,242
- Forty-eight dollars.
- Here's 50.

274
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:20,765
And 2, your change.
And we thank you.
