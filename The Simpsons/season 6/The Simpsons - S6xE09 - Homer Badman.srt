1
00:00:02,217 --> 00:00:04,261
Homer Badman

2
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,130
Damn FDA.
Why can't it all be marshmallow?

3
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:38,000
Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow
pieces back in the box.

4
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:39,652
They go in the trash.

5
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:41,696
You like sweets, kids?

6
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:44,478
I know a place that's sweeter
than sweetness itself.

7
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:48,000
In this sweet place,
earthly doughnuts are sour as poison.

8
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,652
You'd spit them out, you would.

9
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:56,087
I'm talking about
the Candy Industry Trade Show.

10
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:57,435
How did you get tickets?

11
00:00:57,652 --> 00:01:00,087
They hid them in every
millionth Krusty Klump Bar...

12
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:02,000
...and Krusty Klump Bar
with almonds.

13
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,783
Hey. Hey.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,826
I have asked you nicely
not to mangle my merchandise.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,826
You leave me no choice
but to ask you nicely again.

16
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,826
- Can I come to the candy show? Can I?
- No, me. Take me, me, me.

17
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:19,261
Sorry, kids.

18
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:22,696
But this the one event
I want my darling wife by my side.

19
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:26,765
Oh, well, thank you, Homer.
But take one of the kids.

20
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:29,461
Marge, they can't carry enough candy.

21
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:33,070
They have puny little muscles.
Not big, ropy ones like you.

22
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,504
- You go, Mom. For the greater good.
- For the greater good.

23
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:41,939
Homer, are all
these pockets necessary?

24
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:45,243
They wouldn't be if you would
sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.

25
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:49,113
Well, that's the babysitter. No one
in town will sit for you two anymore.

26
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:53,200
I had to choose between a grad student
at the university or a scary-looking hobo.

27
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,809
Please, the hobo.
Please, the hobo. The hobo.

28
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,543
Hi. I'm Ashley Grant.

29
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,959
Ashley Grant. You gave a talk
on women's issues at my school...

30
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,556
...on how we don't have to
be second-class citizens.

31
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:08,240
Mom, how can you leave us
with this maniac?

32
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,664
Hurry. If we're early,
we can get a picture...

33
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,613
...with the two surviving Musketeers.

34
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:15,816
There's also a baby
somewhere upstairs.

35
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:21,314
So you're one of those
"don't-call-me-a-chick" chicks, huh?

36
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,258
Sorry about
my unenlightened brother.

37
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:26,639
He will make
the next few hours a living hell.

38
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,197
Oh, I don't know.

39
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,058
See this, Bart?

40
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,569
Disemboweler IV.

41
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:36,682
The game where condemned criminals
dig at each other with rusty hooks.

42
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:40,102
Do a little housework
and you can play for five minutes.

43
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:42,136
No way.

44
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:46,855
- Yes.
- See, Lisa? Male's aren't hard to tame.

45
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:50,881
They all follow their video cartridges.

46
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,011
Mr. Goodbar to the front desk.

47
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:03,911
The front desk
is looking for Mr. Goodbar.

48
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:08,110
I feel like a kid
in some kind of a store.

49
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:12,872
Brilliant.

50
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,167
Exquisite.

51
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,441
You'll do well. Give me those.

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,162
Well, as you can see,
I have created a lemon ball so sour...

53
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:26,510
...it can only be safely contained
in a magnetic field.

54
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,158
The candy, known as 77X42...

55
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,334
- Where the hell is the candy?
- I don't know.

56
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:41,830
You're gonna have to put some sugar
on that celery or get out, ma'am.

57
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:48,511
Gummi bears. Gummi calves' heads.

58
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:51,319
Gummi jawbreakers.

59
00:03:57,149 --> 00:04:01,021
- What's that?
- That is the rarest gummi of them all.

60
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:04,511
The gummi Venus de Milo,
carved by gummi artisans...

61
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,362
...who work exclusively
in the medium of gummi.

62
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:09,787
Will you two stop saying
"gummi" so much?

63
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,106
Must have rare gummi.
Distract the salesman.

64
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:16,723
No. I won't make a spectacle
out of myself any further.

65
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,319
How did they get there?

66
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:30,681
Now, this is going to take all my skill.

67
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:36,128
- Halt! Halt!
- Run, Marge. Save the booty.

68
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,000
After him. He has the gummi.

69
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:54,681
See you in hell, candy boy!

70
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:08,894
Lis, I found a big caramel deposit
on her back.

71
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:11,234
I'm coming.

72
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,319
Wait a minute. Wait.
Where's my gummi de Milo?

73
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:23,319
Okay, don't panic. She can't
have gotten far. She has no arms.

74
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,723
I'm sure it'll turn up.

75
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:28,085
Take the babysitter home now.
She's been in the car for 20 minutes.

76
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,787
Relax, Marge.
There's plenty for her to do in there.

77
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,723
See? She's having the time of her life.

78
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,255
So a graduate student, huh?

79
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:41,660
How come you can go to the moon,
but can't make my shoes smell good?

80
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,702
- I'm sorry?
- Nobody's blaming you.

81
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:45,660
Could you take the wheel
for a second?

82
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:49,532
- I have to scratch in two places at once.
- Just drop me off here.

83
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,426
Precious Venus.

84
00:06:01,702 --> 00:06:03,617
Thank you.

85
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,404
Hey, kids.
Lots of candy left for breakfast.

86
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:21,532
Why don't we give it
to some needy children then?

87
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,889
The candy conventioneers
tracked us down.

88
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:32,803
There he is. There's the man
that sexually harassed me.

89
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,547
For a minute there I thought
I was in big trouble. It's just a...

90
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:41,384
Two, four, six, eight
Homer's crime was very great

91
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:45,713
"Great" meaning "large or immense"
We use it in the pejorative sense

92
00:06:45,886 --> 00:06:49,306
Marge, I swear I didn't touch her.
You know how bashful I am.

93
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:53,591
I can't even say the word "titmouse"
without giggling like a schoolgirl.

94
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:56,881
At any rate, I believe you.

95
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:59,392
I think you should go outside
and straighten this out.

96
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,249
Some of their chants
are very catchy and memorable.

97
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:07,358
- You grabbed me in the car.
- Oh, that? No.

98
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:10,777
I was grabbing a gummi Venus de Milo
that got stuck to your pants.

99
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:14,760
Yeah, right.
That's the oldest excuse in the book.

100
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:17,314
Come on. I'm a decent guy.

101
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,319
Why would anybody
wanna touch a girl's butt?

102
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:28,223
That's where cooties come from.

103
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,561
I don't understand.
What is she saying you did?

104
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:33,721
Lisa, remember that postcard
Grampa sent us from Florida...

105
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:36,102
...of that alligator
biting that woman's bottom?

106
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,916
Oh, yeah. That was brilliant.

107
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:41,427
That's right.
We all thought it was hilarious.

108
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:43,375
But it turns out we were wrong.

109
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,275
That alligator was
sexually harassing that woman.

110
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:48,026
And the dog in the Coppertone ad?
Same deal?

111
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,781
Well, that's kind of a gray area.

112
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,638
- We know you're innocent, Dad.
- Thanks, kids.

113
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:56,145
They seem to be building some
sort of a shantytown.

114
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:06,188
Do your worst, protestors.
You can't stop me from living my life.

115
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,734
- No respect for women. No peace.
- Try to push the right buttons now.

116
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,331
We ain't crazy about
nuclear power either!

117
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:15,236
You people aren't allowed in here.

118
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,093
It's okay. They're with me.

119
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:27,270
They're ruining my whole life.

120
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,781
Marge, please,
this is where I need you the most.

121
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:33,418
I'm counting on you to do something
or say something to make it all better.

122
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:36,448
- Okay. Go.
- Homer...

123
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,387
I talked to the indignation coordinator
out on the lawn today.

124
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:42,941
I said you were a decent man.
She wouldn't listen.

125
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:46,361
Besides standing by you and
supporting you, there's nothing I can do.

126
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:48,179
You mean, I'm on my own?

127
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,387
I've never been on my own. Oh, no.

128
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,976
On own. On own.
I need help. Oh, God, help me.

129
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:57,660
Help me, God!

130
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:05,322
- Hello?
- Hello, Homer, this is God...

131
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,278
...frey Jones from
the TV magazine show Rock Bottom.

132
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:12,757
We're aware of your problems,
and, Mr. Simpson, we want to help.

133
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:18,061
I saw that report you did on Sasquatch.
It was fair and even-handed.

134
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,626
I'll do it.

135
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,800
Somebody had to take
the babysitter home.

136
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:25,974
Then I noticed she was sitting on the
gummi Venus, so I grabbed it off her.

137
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,235
Oh, just thinking about
that sweet, sweet candy...

138
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:36,322
I just wish I had
another one right now.

139
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:39,626
- But the most important thing is...
- That was great, Mr. Simpson.

140
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:41,365
- We got everything we need.
- Okay.

141
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,670
Say, can you introduce me
to the Sasquatch?

142
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,452
I like his style.

143
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:50,304
Here comes the bouncing ball
of justice.

144
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:51,913
Tonight on Rock Bottom:

145
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:55,478
We go undercover at a sex farm
for sex hookers.

146
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,130
I keep telling you,
I just grow sorghum here.

147
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:02,261
- And where are the hookers?
- Around back.

148
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,826
But first, she was a university honors
student who devoted her life to kids.

149
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:10,783
Until the night a grossly overweight
pervert named Homer Simpson...

150
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:13,522
...gave her a crash course
in depravity.

151
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,565
"Babysitter and the Beast."

152
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:17,348
Oh, crap.

153
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:19,739
Somebody had to take
the babysitter home.

154
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:22,348
Then I noticed she was sitting
on her sweet can...

155
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,261
I grabbed her sweet can...

156
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,652
Oh, just thinking about her can...

157
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,130
I just wish I had
her sweet, sweet, sweet can.

158
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:33,261
So, Mr. Simpson,
you admit you grabbed her can.

159
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,261
What do you have to say
in your defense?

160
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:39,870
Mr. Simpson, your silence
will only incriminate you further.

161
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:44,000
No, Mr. Simpson, don’t take your anger
out on me. Get back. Get back!

162
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,348
- Mr. Simpson, no!
- Dramatization: May not have happened.

163
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:53,391
Marge, kids,
everything's gonna be just fine.

164
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,696
Now go upstairs and pack your bags.

165
00:10:55,826 --> 00:11:00,087
We're gonna start a new life
under the sea.

166
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:14,261
Under the sea

167
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:17,087
Under the sea

168
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,522
There'll be no accusations

169
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:26,043
Just friendly crustaceans
Under the sea

170
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:39,478
That's your solution to everything,
to move under the sea. It won't happen.

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,696
Not with that attitude.

172
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:44,478
Look, maybe this whole thing
will blow over.

173
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:53,087
It didn't blow over, Marge.
Nothing ever blows over for me.

174
00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:09,565
Simpson scandal update.

175
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:13,609
Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent
he believes gives him sexual powers.

176
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,487
Hey, that's a half-truth.

177
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:17,130
Today on Ben:

178
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:21,870
Mothers and runaway daughters reunited
by their hatred of Homer Simpson.

179
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:25,913
And here's your host, Gentle Ben.

180
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:33,087
I just have one thing to say.

181
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:37,435
Let's have less Homer Simpsons
and more money for public schools.

182
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,261
Ben, I have a question.

183
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,826
No, Ben. No.

184
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:57,783
And now we return to
Fox Night at the Movies.

185
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:01,565
Homer S: Portrait of an Ass-Grabber.
Starring Dennis Franz.

186
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:05,783
Portrait. Sounds classy.

187
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,609
Doesn't it?

188
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:20,913
No, Mr. Simpson.
A cat is a living creature.

189
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:22,696
I don’t care.

190
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:29,870
Now I'm gonna grab me
something sweet.

191
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:32,217
No, Mr. Simpson.
That's sexual harassment.

192
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,435
If you keep it up, I'll yell so loud,
the whole country will hear.

193
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,348
With a man in the White House?

194
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,609
Not likely.

195
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:46,935
This is hour 57 of our live,
round-the-clock coverage...

196
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:48,587
...outside the Simpson estate.

197
00:13:48,848 --> 00:13:52,196
Remember to tune in tonight at 8:00
for highlights of today's vigil...

198
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,152
...including when
the garbage man came...

199
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:56,457
...and when Marge Simpson
put the cat out.

200
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,326
Possibly because it was harassed.
We don’t know.

201
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,674
There's no way to see
into the Simpson home...

202
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:04,761
...without some kind of infrared,
heat-sensitive camera.

203
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,848
So let's turn it on.

204
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:09,196
Now, this technology is new to me...

205
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,152
...but I'm pretty sure
that's Homer Simpson in the oven...

206
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,804
...rotating slowly. His body temperature
has risen to over 400 degrees.

207
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:19,109
He's literally stewing
in his own juices.

208
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,674
Now here are some results
from our phone-in poll.

209
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,978
Ninety-five percent of the people
believe Homer Simpson is guilty.

210
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,152
Of course,
this is just a television poll...

211
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,891
...which is not legally binding,
unless Proposition 304 passes.

212
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:32,326
And we all pray it will.

213
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,196
I don't have a friend in the world.

214
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:38,717
- Let us through.
- We're Homer's true friends.

215
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,761
Oh, really?

216
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:45,674
- Come on, let us through, you vultures.
- Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.

217
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,283
How can you judge this man...

218
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,152
...without talking to the people
who know him best?

219
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,891
We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson,
and the bidding starts at 10 G's.

220
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:55,804
- I bid 10 G's.
- Ten-five G's.

221
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,135
I need a hug.

222
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,743
How come you guys hesitated?

223
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:09,526
Sorry, Dad.
We do believe in you. We really do.

224
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:11,439
It's just hard not to listen to TV.

225
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:13,830
It's spent so much more time
raising us than you.

226
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:16,570
Maybe TV is right.

227
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,787
TV's always right.

228
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,657
Are you hugging the TV?

229
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,439
- No.
- No.

230
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:38,804
And the number one reference
that I am running into the ground is:

231
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:41,060
Homer Simpson.

232
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,736
Is Homer Simpson.

233
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:58,413
I like it better when they're
making fun of people who aren't me.

234
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,322
I know. Evening at the Improv.

235
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,925
They never talk about anything
beyond the 1980s.

236
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,660
I think about weird stuff.

237
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:07,958
Like, what would happen if E. T.
And Mr. T had a baby?

238
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:10,083
Well, you'd get Mr. E. T.,
wouldn't you?

239
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,641
And, you know, I think he'd sound
a little something like this:

240
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:17,632
"I pity the fool
who doesn't phone home."

241
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:20,576
I wouldn't wanna be
Mr. T right now.

242
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,481
Homer. Homer, the kids have a
great idea how you can clear your name.

243
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:27,561
The media's making you a monster
because they don't care about truth.

244
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:29,340
All they care about is entertainment.

245
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:32,767
You need a forum where they don't
know the meaning of entertainment:

246
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:35,023
Public access television.

247
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,754
- But those shows all look so crummy.
- Well, we could dress it up a bit.

248
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:42,095
We can bring a fern,
and a folding chair from the garage...

249
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:45,262
...and the most decorative thing of all,
the truth.

250
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,934
There are only 49 stars on that flag.

251
00:16:56,108 --> 00:17:00,099
I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground
before I recognize Missouri.

252
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,566
Now it's time for
The Innocence Report...

253
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,214
...with Homer Simpson.

254
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:09,789
Hello. I am Homer Simpson.

255
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,476
Or, as some of you wags
have dubbed me, "Father Goose."

256
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:17,815
You know, everybody believed
the worst about me right away.

257
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:19,984
Nobody cares that I didn't do it.

258
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:21,416
But I didn't.

259
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:24,539
Okay, look, I've done
some bad things in my life.

260
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:27,446
But harassing women
is not one of them.

261
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:31,654
Like one time, we were having this race
with this stupid, old-timey bicycle...

262
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,216
...with the big wheel in front.

263
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,472
So I figure, "We'll see about that."

264
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:39,160
So I get this big chunk
of cinderblock, and I...

265
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:41,719
Oh, gotta go.

266
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,194
Innocent.

267
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,884
Dad, you did it. I am so proud of you.

268
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:48,487
The switchboards are lighting up.

269
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,524
Two calls. That's our best ever.

270
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,997
Hello? No, Janice doesn't live here.

271
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:57,468
Hello? Yes, I am interested
in long-distance savings.

272
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,810
Very interested.

273
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,754
Marge, this is so depressing.

274
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:09,528
My only hope
is this homemade Prozac.

275
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:12,565
Needs more ice cream.

276
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:16,979
So you don't like
the old-time bikes, huh?

277
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,395
Homer, I love amateur video.

278
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:28,822
And your show
is the most amateur video I ever saw.

279
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:32,944
My hobby is secretly
videotaping couples in cars.

280
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:36,024
I didn't come forward
because in this country...

281
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,150
...it makes you look like a pervert.

282
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,968
But every single
Scottish person does it!

283
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:46,523
Oh, baby. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.

284
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:48,475
Oh, no. That's Mayor Quimby.

285
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,599
Here we go.

286
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,332
Precious Venus.

287
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:59,061
Thank you.

288
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:03,833
Dad, this clears you completely.

289
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:06,089
You know, the courts might not
work anymore...

290
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:09,083
...but as long as everybody
is videotaping everyone else...

291
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,295
...justice will be done.

292
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:14,723
See?

293
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,282
Homer, I thought you were an animal.

294
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:19,625
But your daughter said
you were a decent man.

295
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:23,183
- I guess she was right.
- You're both right.

296
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:26,567
In our mad pursuit of a scoop...

297
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:30,384
...we members of the press
sometimes make mistakes.

298
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:33,248
Rock Bottom would like to make
the following corrections:

299
00:19:35,764 --> 00:19:38,454
Wow, V8 juice
isn't one-eighth gasoline.

300
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:42,836
- And Ted Koppel is a robot.
- There's you, Dad.

301
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:46,263
Tomorrow on Rock Bottom.

302
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:50,775
He's a foreigner who takes perverted
videos of you when you least suspect it.

303
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:53,161
He's "Rowdy Roddy Peeper".

304
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,075
Oh, that man is sick.

305
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,114
Groundskeeper Willie
saved you, Homer.

306
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,630
But listen to the music. He's evil.

307
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:04,231
Hasn't this experience taught you
you can't believe everything you hear?

308
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:08,700
Marge, my friend,
I haven't learned a thing.

309
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,678
Let's never fight again.
