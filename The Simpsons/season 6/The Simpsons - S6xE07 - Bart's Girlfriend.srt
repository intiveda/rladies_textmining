1
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:06,317
BART'S GIRLFRIEND

2
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,900
Remember, Bart...
I mean, Dances in Underwear.

3
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:44,775
We take the white man alive.

4
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:48,108
All right, Thinks Too Much.
It shall be so.

5
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:52,983
Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns.
I mean, Native Americans.

6
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,483
They're after us because we gave them
blankets infected with cooties.

7
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:58,650
I ate all my caps.

8
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:02,525
Throw down your weapons
and kiss the prairie, cow dorks!

9
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,483
Why do we have to play
this corny old game anyway?

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,400
I brought my jacks!

11
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:12,108
I got twosies!

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,483
That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have
the Killmatic 3000 back then.

13
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:24,358
Hey, records from that era
are spotty at best.

14
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:31,650
Bart! Lisa! Time for church!

15
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,567
Milhouse, time for church!

16
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:36,483
Shlomo, time for your violin lesson!

17
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:55,567
Why the crap do we have
to go church anyway?

18
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,525
You just answered your own question
with that commode mouth.

19
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:01,275
Besides, you kids need to learn
morals and decency...

20
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:03,067
...and how to love your fellow man.

21
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:08,942
And with flaming swords, the Aramites
did pierce the eyes of their fellow men...

22
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:11,983
...and did feast on what flowed forth.

23
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:15,733
Among whom also we all
once conducted ourselves...

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,525
...in the lusts of our flesh...

25
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:19,733
I'm a troll man

26
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,025
I'm a troll man

27
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,275
I don't want you playing with something
that has such bizarre hair.

28
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,692
Awful, awful hair.

29
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,275
And now my daughter, Jessica...

30
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:37,650
...who has just returned
from boarding school...

31
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:40,233
...will read the same passage
I just read.

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,150
I noticed a few of you
weren't paying attention.

33
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:53,400
Wow, there is a God.

34
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,833
I'm telling you, the light would
work better if it pointed out to sea!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,708
Shut up, I know what I'm doing.

36
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,625
I hate the sea and everything in it.

37
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,708
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Thank you for choosing our church.

38
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,458
I've never felt this way
about a girl before.

39
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:20,083
My long search is finally over.

40
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,792
Hi, I'm Bart Simpson.

41
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,583
I was incredibly moved by your reading.

42
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,958
I don't think God's words
have ever sounded so plausible.

43
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,250
Thanks, Art.

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,125
I have to go over here now.

45
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart.

46
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,375
It's not your fault Jessica
doesn't like you.

47
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,333
Is it my hair? My overbite?

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,583
The fact that I've worn the same clothes
for the last four years?

49
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:56,750
No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica
are too different to get along.

50
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:02,083
She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter,
and you're the devil's cabana boy.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,375
Good. Very good.

52
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,750
Ralph, Jesus did not have wheels.

53
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,417
- Bart Simpson?
- Yes, ma'am.

54
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,708
I'd like to return to your wonderful
Sunday school, please.

55
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,333
But, Bart, we banned you
from Sunday school.

56
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,958
You were happy. We were happy.
Everybody was happy.

57
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,792
Particularly the hamster.

58
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,417
I've changed my ways.

59
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,833
Please give me
another chance, ma'am.

60
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:37,875
All right, Bart.
The Bible does teach forgiveness.

61
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:41,208
Class, I want you to welcome back
our prodigal son.

62
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,250
- What?
- What's prodigal mean?

63
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,667
Oh, dear.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,375
You know, the great thing about
Sunday school...

65
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:50,125
...is we're finally learning
something we can use.

66
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,917
Yeah, so true.

67
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,625
I have to turn my chair this way now.

68
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,925
Somehow I gotta convince her
I'm a good person.

69
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:04,133
All right, I have to sit here and behave,
no matter what.

70
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,467
Okay, class. We have a special
treat today for pass-around.

71
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:11,383
A replica of the slingshot
David used to slay Goliath.

72
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,383
While you kids are looking at that,
I'll just busy myself in this file cabinet.

73
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:23,800
Must fight Satan.

74
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,133
Make it up to him...

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,008
...later.

76
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:34,717
You know, I was considering
staying after school...

77
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:37,300
...and helping teacher clean up.

78
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:40,592
Do you ever think anything
you don't say?

79
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:46,008
There is just no pleasing
a girl like that!

80
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:49,008
All that unnecessary behaving.

81
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm all tense through the chestal area.
I need relief.

82
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:03,092
Now, the kilt was only
for day-to-day wear.

83
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:08,050
In battle, we donned a full-length
ball gown covered in sequins.

84
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:12,467
The idea was to blind
your opponent with luxury.

85
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,050
'Tis no more than what God gave me,
you Puritan pukes.

86
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:26,383
That'll hold me, at least till I get
my hands on some kind of explosives.

87
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,092
Congratulations, Simpson.

88
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:37,383
You just fell for our sting and won
yourself three months' detention.

89
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:40,633
There's no such thing
as Scotchtoberfest!

90
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:45,425
There's not? You used me, Skinner!
You used me!

91
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,925
Three months?

92
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:51,175
Hi, Bart.

93
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:56,008
I saw the way they set you up.
That was really unfair.

94
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,633
Wanna have dinner
at my house tonight?

95
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,467
Really? Sure.

96
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,592
Great. We eat at 7.

97
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,133
There's only one thing to do
at a moment like this:

98
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,383
Strut.

99
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:26,967
So, Bart, how's school going?
Jessica always gets straight A's.

100
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,675
Well, in my family,
grades aren't that important.

101
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:31,925
It's what you learn that counts.

102
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:33,842
Six times five! What is it?

103
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:36,967
Actually, numbers don't have
much use in my future career:

104
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,175
Olympic gold-medal rocket-sled champ!

105
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,925
I didn't know the rocket sled
was an Olympic event.

106
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:45,383
Well, no offense, but what you
don't know could fill a warehouse.

107
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,300
Young man, explain yourself!

108
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,217
Sorry. I have kind of a short fuse,
which some find charming.

109
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:54,133
Speaking of charming,
watching Fox last night...

110
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,675
...I heard a rather amusing story.

111
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,967
This character named Martin
was feeling rather randy...

112
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,633
...and he was heard to remark...

113
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:06,342
And don't you ever come near
my daughter again!

114
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:09,508
Never have I heard such
gratuitous use of the word "butt"!

115
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:11,425
- But... But... But...
- Make him stop!

116
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,675
- But... But... But...
- Make him stop!

117
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,633
You're bad, Bart Simpson.

118
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,425
No, I'm not. I'm really...

119
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:27,092
Yes, you are. You're bad.
And I like it.

120
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,842
I'm bad to the bone, honey.

121
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,717
- Let's go find some fun.
- But your father said...

122
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:35,300
I told the rev I was going
to my room to say my prayers.

123
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:39,717
Smart, beautiful and a liar.

124
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,800
So much better than that
Sarah, plain and tall.

125
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:02,425
Right there! Put that there!

126
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,925
Excellent! You're incredible, Jessica.

127
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,967
Your throws, your catches,
your spirals, your loops.

128
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:12,425
It's like the toilet paper
is an extension of your body.

129
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:17,217
No way would a minister's daughter
go out with you.

130
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:18,925
Oh, yeah? I'll prove it.

131
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,050
- Hey, Jessica.
- Yes?

132
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:25,050
- Am I supposed to know you?
- Jessica, we just...

133
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:29,008
That's for besmirching
an innocent girl's name.

134
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:34,225
- Why?
- I'm sorry, Bart.

135
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:37,183
You know my parents
can't find out about us.

136
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,892
And besides, if it's secret,
it's even more exciting.

137
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,642
- I guess.
- Hey, you wanna go skateboarding?

138
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:48,725
Actually, I was hoping I could
sit down for just a second.

139
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,600
Come on, it'll be fun.

140
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:57,683
Now I have the energy to do anything.

141
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:00,433
Just give me two minutes.

142
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,308
Jessica, I think this is too steep.

143
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:10,392
Bart, you can't trust your perception
at this altitude.

144
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:19,142
Actually, if the road surface
maintains its integrity...

145
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,142
...I just might be able to hold on.

146
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,517
The glue will slow me down.

147
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:42,058
- Any glue leaking?
- No. That glue ain't going nowhere.

148
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,258
Nothing's ever gonna stop me.

149
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:56,800
Oh, no. There goes the glue after all.

150
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,008
Fun, huh?

151
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,217
Have you noticed any change in Bart?

152
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,883
- New glasses?
- No.

153
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,300
He looks like something
might be disturbing him.

154
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:22,300
Probably misses his old glasses.

155
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:25,092
I guess we could get more involved
in Bart's activities.

156
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,508
But then I'd be afraid
of smothering him.

157
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:30,758
- Yeah. And then we'd get the chair.
- That's not what I meant.

158
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,383
It was, Marge. Admit it.

159
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,342
- Hi.
- We should get to class.

160
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,425
- What's the hurry?
- We could get in trouble for being late.

161
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,133
You worry too much.

162
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:47,425
Come on. If you stay here a while,
I'll let you hold my hand.

163
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:56,258
Teamwork! Come on, Bart.

164
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:04,217
If I don't save the wee turtles,
who will?

165
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:12,133
Save me from the wee turtles!
They were too quick for me!

166
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:13,883
I can't believe it, Bart.

167
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,092
I'd always thought Jessica
was so sweet.

168
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,717
She's like a Milk Dud, Lis:

169
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:20,967
Sweet on the outside,
poison on the inside.

170
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,925
- You gotta give her up.
- No, no, wait. Hear my plan.

171
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,342
Put up with her for seven more years.

172
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:27,800
Then we'll get married.

173
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:31,300
Once the first baby comes, she's bound
to settle down and treat me right.

174
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,800
After all, I deserve it.

175
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:36,008
Bart, it's naive to think
you can change a person.

176
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:39,467
Except maybe that boy
who works in the library.

177
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,842
Do you have Go, Dog, Go?

178
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:45,842
That's in Juvenile.
This is Young Adult.

179
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,758
Well-read and just a little wild.

180
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,175
If only someone could tame him.

181
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:55,800
You're right, Lisa.
Love isn't about fixing someone.

182
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,175
I'm just gonna give her up cold turkey.

183
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:02,217
I'm not gonna talk to her or see her.
It's over.

184
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,425
Thanks for the advice, sis.

185
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:18,008
There. If I can just get through
this many days without seeing her...

186
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:20,383
...she should be completely
out of my system.

187
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,550
Okay, day one.

188
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,425
Time for church, Bart.

189
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,300
I bet your little friend Jessica
will be there.

190
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:39,217
- Jessica.
- Bart, be strong.

191
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,050
You don't need that little hellcat.

192
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:45,383
Oh, Lis, she's already
drawn me to her...

193
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,133
...with her beautiful siren song.

194
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:58,800
That's very disturbing.

195
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:02,258
Hey, Bart. What? What's wrong?

196
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:07,342
Well, Jessica, I don't think we should
hang out together anymore.

197
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:11,675
You're turning me into a criminal
when all I want to be is a petty thug.

198
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:15,217
Oh, good.
Here comes the collection plate.

199
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:25,133
"Thirty cents off Shake ’N' Bake."

200
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:27,675
- Homer!
- We can spare it, Marge.

201
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,175
We've been blessed.

202
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:32,008
You're right about everything, Bart.

203
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,175
I have been too reckless.

204
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:38,258
From now on,
I am going to settle down.

205
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:43,467
Jessica, what are you doing?

206
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,175
Well, it takes money
to start a new life.

207
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:50,008
Stealing from the collection basket
is really wrong. Even I know that.

208
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,092
Fine. You just lost your cut.

209
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:55,133
I'll just take that.

210
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:59,592
Everyone turn around and look at this.

211
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,467
What is it? A Unitarian?

212
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,633
Now just relax. For once,
you didn't do anything wrong.

213
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:11,300
Just explain yourself
and everyone will understand.

214
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,175
- L...
- Took the money? Yes, we know.

215
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:15,425
- He confessed!
- Okay.

216
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,467
Stop him!
He's headed for the window!

217
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,992
Son, if you look me in the eye and say
you didn't take the collection money...

218
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,075
...that's all I need.

219
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,158
- I didn't take it.
- Why, you little...

220
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:31,950
How can you lie like that?

221
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:34,533
Homer, stop that! I believe him.

222
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:38,867
Tell me, if he didn't take the money,
why is he wearing those fancy clothes?

223
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:40,783
That's what he wore to church.

224
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,492
How convenient.

225
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:45,367
Bart, honey, do you know
who did take the money?

226
00:15:47,742 --> 00:15:49,533
- No.
- See, son?

227
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:51,658
Telling the truth isn't so bad.

228
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:58,075
- Boo!
- Boo!

229
00:15:58,242 --> 00:15:59,867
- Why, you little...!
- Crook!

230
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,117
- Thief!
- Stealer of money from the church!

231
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:07,408
We've gotta talk.

232
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:10,908
Listen, thanks for not turning me in.
That was sweet.

233
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:14,783
Well, it seems like if you really
care for me, you should come forward.

234
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,242
Don't you see? It's because I care
for you that I can't come forward.

235
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:20,742
That doesn't make any sense.

236
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,783
Then I just don't feel like it, okay?

237
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:26,825
Jessica, you're really beautiful,
but you are not very nice.

238
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,880
With the way you treat me,
why should I protect you?

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,920
Because if you tell,
no one will believe you.

240
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,440
Remember, I'm the sweet,
perfect minister's daughter.

241
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,040
And you're just yellow trash.

242
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,675
And her hair smells
like red Froot Loops.

243
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,717
Yeah? Well, I eat Froot Loops
for breakfast.

244
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,717
Because of last week's problems...

245
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:17,883
...we'll be taking certain precautions
with this week's collection.

246
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,383
We shouldn't have let them do this.
It can't be helping his self-esteem.

247
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,046
Now for our offertory reading,
Lisa Simpson...

248
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:28,557
...who we'll all be keeping an eye on.

249
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:34,358
I know most of you have already judged
my brother guilty without any proof.

250
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:39,986
But doesn't the Bible teach us
"judge not, lest ye be judged," Reverend?

251
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,540
I think it may be somewhere
towards the back.

252
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:45,224
There is someone among us
with a guilty conscience.

253
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,639
After much soul-searching, I decided
it would be wrong of me to name names.

254
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:54,315
But I urge that guilty person here,
under the eyes of God...

255
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:56,522
...to come forward, to confess...

256
00:17:56,696 --> 00:18:01,284
...and save yourself from the torment
of your own personal hell!

257
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:04,142
I smelled some marijuana smoke
in Vietnam!

258
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:06,566
I was the one that canceled Star Trek!

259
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:09,899
I left my Porsche keys
inside Mrs. Glick.

260
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,800
I am talking to
the collection-money thief!

261
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:17,561
Only you can come forward
and end this injustice!

262
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:23,882
Oh, what the heck.
It was Jessica Lovejoy!

263
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,120
If you search her room,
I am certain you will find the money.

264
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:31,587
- To the little girl's room!
- Yeah!

265
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:35,787
That's the collection money!

266
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,691
Oh, yeah. Smells like church.

267
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,986
I guess it's obvious
what's happened here.

268
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,271
Bart Simpson has somehow managed
to sneak his bedroom into my house.

269
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:49,293
Well, come on! Use your imaginations!

270
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,843
No, Dad. I did it.

271
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:57,172
It's your classic cry for attention.

272
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,942
Well, young lady, I suppose
we brought you home...

273
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,583
...from boarding school
a little prematurely.

274
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,007
I was expelled, Dad.

275
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,258
Remember the pipe bomb?
The glee club brawl?

276
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:09,726
Remember the school chapel
collection plate?

277
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:14,401
The exploding toilets ring a bell?
Come on, Dad, pay attention to me!

278
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:15,960
Hello, in there. Hello?

279
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,159
I think you all owe my son an apology.

280
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:23,059
- Very sorry.
- That's okay. Appreciate it.

281
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:30,548
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Bart.

282
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,410
Come to watch me suffer?

283
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,522
I just wanted to let you know that even
though this was a difficult experience...

284
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:38,514
...I really learned a lot.

285
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm a little wiser
and a little less naive.

286
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:47,735
Well, I learned that I can make men
do whatever I want.

287
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:52,107
Well, don't you see, Jessica?
Then you really haven't learned...

288
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:54,315
Would you finish scrubbing these steps?

289
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,479
Will I?

290
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,666
Hey, Jessica!

291
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:02,571
Coming!

292
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:10,450
Poor sucker. It's amazing what
some guys will do for a pretty face.

293
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,095
Not me though.

294
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:16,294
Wait till she sees the second-rate job
I do on these stairs.
