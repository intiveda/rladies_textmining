1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,633
Homer vs. Patty and Selma

2
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,009
This place is gonna smell classy
all week.

3
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,593
To Homer, the Wall Street genius!

4
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:45,244
Hey, Homer, how come you got
money to burn? Or singe, anyway.

5
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,432
- Yeah, what's your secret investment?
- Take a guess.

6
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:50,479
Pumpkins?

7
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:54,103
Yeah, that's right, Barney.
This year, I invested in pumpkins.

8
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,553
They've been going up
the whole month of October.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,110
And I got a feeling they're gonna peak
right around January.

10
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:02,593
And bang! That's when I'll cash in.

11
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:05,110
To Homer!
And to Sergeant Pepper...

12
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:08,365
...who's growing out of
the middle of your back!

13
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,888
Barn, you gotta unwrap the
plastic before you smoke these.

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,331
- Hey, Homer.
- Yeah!

15
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:15,647
- Hey, Homer.
- Way to go.

16
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:23,499
I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell
your pumpkin futures before Halloween.

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,687
Let's not panic. I'll make the money back
by selling a liver.

18
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:28,163
I can get by with one.

19
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:31,318
Oh, how am I gonna tell Marge
we're broke?

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,365
I need a miracle.

21
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,278
My house is on fire!

22
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,190
Insurance to the rescue!

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,633
- Hello, Homer.
- Hello, Homer.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,452
Marge, we had a deal.

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,412
Your sisters don't come here after 6,
and I stop eating your lipstick.

26
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,324
This is a special occasion.

27
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:55,206
Patty and Selma just got promoted
at the DMV.

28
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:59,737
Yeah, Homer. Let your wife
have a glimpse of success for once.

29
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:02,790
All right, that's the last straw.

30
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:05,441
Time to take out the trash!

31
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,193
But first, I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

32
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:19,468
I'm sorry.
Homer doesn't mean to be rude.

33
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:21,985
He's just a very complicated man.

34
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:23,461
Wrong!

35
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,347
When are you going to wake up
and smell your husband, Marge?

36
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,126
You got some kids out of him.

37
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:31,347
But when the seeds have been planted,
you throw away the envelope.

38
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:35,206
I wish you wouldn't put Homer down.
He may not be a big success like you...

39
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:38,629
...but I can always count on him
to provide for the family.

40
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:42,857
Sweet, trusting Marge, I can't let you
down. I'll get some money somehow.

41
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:49,703
Hello, Vegas?
Give me a hundred bucks on red.

42
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:52,589
All right. I'll send you a check.

43
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:56,716
If only I could think of an invention.

44
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,696
Something that would
really make money.

45
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:02,958
Must concentrate and work
harder than I've ever worked...

46
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:09,468
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.

47
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:13,227
This invention of yours has made us
all rich, especially you.

48
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,649
It's simple, yet ingenious.
And it fits right in the palm of your hand.

49
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:20,341
Every person in America now owns one
of these. In many cases, three or four.

50
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:22,052
Can I just get a look at that?

51
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,844
Why would you need to see it? You're
the genius who invented the product.

52
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,622
- But could I just...?
- Don't worry.

53
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,812
You'll get to see it just as soon
as we unveil our new ad campaign.

54
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,739
- Let me see! Out of the way!
- Homer!

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,296
Homer, wake up! There's still
a few minutes till our usual bedtime.

56
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:41,276
No! My invention!

57
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:43,557
- My money problems could've...
- Money problems?

58
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,208
Homer, are we in some sort
of fiduciary trouble?

59
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,678
Oh, Marge, my loyal wife...

60
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,490
...of course not.

61
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:56,510
And Lisa, my little princess.

62
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:59,262
And who could forget dear Rat Boy?

63
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,316
Rat Boy? I resent that.

64
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:05,638
Bart, I told you before.
Stop gnawing on the drywall.

65
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:09,732
What a day, eh, Milhouse?
The sun is out, birds are singing...

66
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,718
...bees are trying to have sex
with them, as I understand it.

67
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:16,645
It is a gorgeously fabulous day.
Marvelous, even.

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,571
So, what's your hurry
to get to school?

69
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,027
Nothing. What's your hurry?

70
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:29,296
That's enough, Bart. Fun is fun,
but if we're late, we'll get in trouble.

71
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:32,517
You're right, Milhouse.
Fun is fun.

72
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:40,470
Attention, students. It's time to choose
a gym class for the coming term.

73
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:42,349
So let's prove how adult we can be...

74
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:44,900
...by filing to the gym
in a calm, orderly manner.

75
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:49,061
Even though it's first come, first serve,
and the popular sports fill up fast.

76
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:53,826
Too many wee ones!

77
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:58,994
This gets uglier every year.
Any sign of Bart and Milhouse?

78
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:02,685
No, and if they don't get here soon,
it'll be T.S. For them.

79
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,282
I don't feel right.

80
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:11,141
Do you hear that, Bart?
That was the tardy bell!

81
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:14,866
"Truant! Truant! Truant!"
They'll all say!

82
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,356
Who needs him?
I can have fun all by myself.

83
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:22,953
It's all right? It's all right.
It's all right? It's all right.

84
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:27,316
Sure, Homer, I can loan
you the money you need.

85
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,369
However, since you
have no collateral...

86
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,188
...I'm gonna have to break your legs
in advance.

87
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,369
Gosh, Moe.
I use these all the time.

88
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:38,222
- Couldn't you bash my head in?
- Hey, are you a loan shark?

89
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:40,571
Do you understand
how finance works?

90
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,252
Now, let's do this thing.

91
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,648
- Oh, no. It's P.E. Sign-up day.
- How could you forget?

92
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:54,796
They had signs posted
all over the library.

93
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:58,789
Better sign up for something fast, man.
Baseball just filled up...

94
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:01,541
So did tae kwon do.

95
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,178
There's only one class left...

96
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:15,198
...but it happens to be
the coolest one of all.

97
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:18,923
Ballet? Dancing is for girls.

98
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,104
Well, you should've gotten here earlier.

99
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,863
I need an extension
on my mortgage payments.

100
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,749
I understand, Mr. Simpson,
but according to our computer...

101
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,561
...your credit history is not good.

102
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:33,017
It says here that you've been
pre-declined for every major credit card.

103
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,769
It also says that you grabbed a dog
by the hind legs...

104
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,655
...and pushed him like a vacuum.
- In the third grade!

105
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,567
It all goes on your permanent record.

106
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,185
Sorry, but if you don't have
that money by tomorrow...

107
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:46,004
...the bank will take your house.
- Good luck finding it.

108
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:49,158
- I'll take the numbers off.
- We'll find a house with no numbers.

109
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,071
I'll take off my neighbor's numbers.

110
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:54,896
So then we'll look for the house next
to the house with no numbers.

111
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,282
All right, you'll get your money.

112
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:02,342
You're my last, last chance, bottom
of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot...

113
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,899
...wish you would, but probably won't,
final resort to lend me money.

114
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,020
- We'll take care of you.
- Yes. Care.

115
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:32,778
Cut him a check
and get him the hell out of here.

116
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:38,193
What a wonderful dinner.
What a beautiful family.

117
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,274
Get a picture of me with this steak.

118
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,354
You're certainly in a good mood, Dad.

119
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:45,810
Well, Lisa, I managed to solve
a little problem today.

120
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:48,864
And to celebrate,
I'm going to tilt my chair.

121
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,797
Slanty.

122
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,213
Patty, Selma.
What are you doing here?

123
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:59,401
We thought we'd stop by
unexpectedly for dinner.

124
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:02,388
Now, bring us extra chairs
like a good "blubber"- in-law.

125
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:03,998
Time to fertilize the lawn.

126
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,086
A couple of 500-pound bags
should do it!

127
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,072
Be careful with my sisters' heads.
Their necks are brittle.

128
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,086
That's okay, Marge.
Nothing's broke.

129
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:14,166
Except Homer.

130
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:17,656
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

131
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:23,361
It means these two fabulous babes
are staying for dinner.

132
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,280
Now, there's a stink
I could've done without.

133
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:28,965
This has been such a nice,
peaceful dinner.

134
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:33,394
It calls for a celebration. I'll make the
most international coffee in the house:

135
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:36,549
Montreal Morn.

136
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:40,307
All right, you had your fun,
now get lost.

137
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:42,018
Our fun hasn't begun yet.

138
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,032
We know something
you don't want Marge to know.

139
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,193
Now we own you,
like Siegfried owns Roy.

140
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:56,482
I'm sorry. All we have is Nescafé.

141
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,112
- I'm very, very sorry.
- Oh, Marge, Marge. You're just in time.

142
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,831
Homer's getting ready
to give us a foot rub.

143
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:06,314
- You are?
- No! L...

144
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:11,012
I'm giving them a foot massage.

145
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:13,193
At least let me have that.

146
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,307
You can start with the corns.

147
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:17,891
Then you can move on
to bunion country.

148
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,410
Okay. Steady, Bart.

149
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,833
Taking ballet doesn't make you
any less of a man.

150
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:33,424
All right, girls. Today we learn
the dance of the fairy queens.

151
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:37,316
You can either be a fairy or a queen.
It's wide open.

152
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:40,974
And what have we here?

153
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:44,095
A young man maybe who thinks
he can be the next Baryshnikov.

154
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:47,988
I don't wanna be the next anything.
They made me take this stupid class.

155
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:51,880
So he has fire in the belly.
But it will take more than belly fire...

156
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:55,840
...to be the next Baryshnikov!
- Look, Boris, I think ballet's for sissies.

157
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:59,363
Ballet is for the strong,
the fierce, the determined.

158
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,545
But for the sissies, never.

159
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:05,571
Now, put on this fuchsia-tard.
You are a fairy!

160
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,061
- Quitting time.
- On the way home...

161
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:12,618
...we'll stop at Moe's for a Zima.
- Maybe I'll stay and work overtime.

162
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,672
My sisters-in-law
are at my house again.

163
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,451
Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity.

164
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,001
Pull yourself together
and come get drunk with us.

165
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:29,162
- Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?
- I don't like wearing tights.

166
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,780
But so many of your heroes
wear tights.

167
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:36,343
- Batman, for example. And Magellan.
- Look, I don't like this cootie platoon...

168
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,001
...and I never will. I'm out of here,
and I'm out of this stupid outfit.

169
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,578
Wait!
Joy of movement, increasing.

170
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,827
Love of dance, impossible to resist.

171
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:53,692
Toes twinkling. Look at me, girls.

172
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,149
I'm doing ballet. And I love it!

173
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,853
Am I wrong,
or did it just get fatter in here?

174
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:06,813
- Request permission to slink by.
- Permission pending.

175
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:09,431
First, light our cigarettes.

176
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,444
But you're already smoking cig...

177
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:18,184
- You're really pushing it.
- Come on, Homer.

178
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:21,573
You can't spell "obsequious"
without l-O-U.

179
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:24,895
- I'll have to trust you on that.
- Marge was always a good speller.

180
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:27,143
- Let's ask her.
- No! Don't tell Marge!

181
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,425
I'll be good. I'll be good.

182
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:39,425
Just for that, you have to crawl around
on the floor like the dog you are.

183
00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:42,680
But... Yes, ma'am.

184
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:48,821
Now say, "I am Homer Simpson,
the lowly dog. " In a dog voice!

185
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:52,378
- I am Homer Simpson.
- Well, good. Jump, Homer, jump.

186
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,365
- What's going on in here?
- Absolutely nothing, Marge.

187
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,043
- What's that paper?
- What paper?

188
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:04,828
Homer, is this projection accurate?

189
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,781
- Did you borrow money from my sisters?
- I don't know, Marge.

190
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:10,533
I can't keep track
of all my wheelings and dealings.

191
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:14,593
- He blew your savings on jack-o'- lanterns.
- You told!

192
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,472
Sorry, Marge.

193
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:25,700
I never want to see you again!
You either.

194
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:29,157
Homer.
Homer, why didn't you tell me?

195
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:32,848
I was ashamed, Marge.
I failed you as a husband and a provider.

196
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:35,432
And at best, I was a B-plus dog.

197
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:38,754
I'll understand if you wanna sleep
on the couch tonight.

198
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:46,281
- How's Dad today?
- Not too good, Lisa.

199
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:50,543
- Frankly, he's underneath the table.
- Nobody make me any breakfast.

200
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,992
A man so deeply in debt
doesn't deserve it.

201
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,274
But I like to make you breakfast.

202
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:59,267
In that case, I'll just have French toast
with double butter and a side of bacon.

203
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:02,757
But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it.
Maybe a little powdered sugar.

204
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:12,690
See that?
I started to do, like, a little arabesque.

205
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,382
But then I just fully went for it
and pulled off the demi-entrechat.

206
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,294
Not that I'm into that kind of thing.

207
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:23,663
Bravissimo, Bart!
Next week, class gives its first recital.

208
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:27,153
And you, you will dance the male lead.

209
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:30,643
Dance in front of my whole school?
What is it with you and ballet?

210
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,066
I know you have great conflict, Bart.
You love ballet.

211
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:37,623
Yet you feel the boys
will laugh at you, no?

212
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,536
No, I fear the girls
will laugh at me.

213
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:42,019
I fear the boys will beat
the snot out of me.

214
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:47,153
- Hey, Dad. What you doing?
- Daddy has very important work to do.

215
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:50,308
He's looking through the want ads
to find a part-time job.

216
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,657
Dad, that's a gag paper
we got at the carnival.

217
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:56,986
No wonder I didn't hear about Bart being
elected world's greatest sex machine.

218
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:59,737
- I'll never pay off that debt!
- Need money fast?

219
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,153
Got no experience?
Step up to elegance.

220
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:05,576
- Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.
- That's it!

221
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,939
I'll make money with a chauffeur job!
Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa.

222
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:12,019
I didn't turn it on, I thought you did.

223
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:14,637
No. Well, anyway, turn it off.

224
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:16,247
It is off.

225
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:25,102
You have to work hard
to win this crowd over.

226
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,726
- Most of them are here for detention.
- Pretty big crowd.

227
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:32,048
We even bused in troublemakers
from other schools.

228
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,068
That spiky-haired, masked dancer
is really something.

229
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:48,961
- I wonder who he is.
- He's graceful, yet masculine.

230
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,209
So it's okay for me to enjoy this.

231
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:58,781
Oh, wow, I can't believe my very first
passenger is comedy legend Mel Brooks.

232
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:02,439
I loved that movie Young Frankenstein.
Scared the hell out of me.

233
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:07,674
- Thanks.
- Let's do that 2000-pound-man thing.

234
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,727
I'll be that Carl Reiner guy,
and you be what's-his-face.

235
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,345
It's not easy.
It takes the genius of Carl Reiner...

236
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,123
...and the timing that only we...

237
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,774
Sir, today, every country
has a national anthem.

238
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:21,130
Did they have national anthems
2000 years ago?

239
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:23,982
Sure! Sure we had.
Of course, we was caves.

240
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,365
But every cave had a national anthem.

241
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:29,251
I'll never forget
my cave's national anthem.

242
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:35,660
- What was that national anthem?
- Let them all go to hell except Cave 76

243
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,150
What's with the si...?
What's with the siren?

244
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:42,640
Evening, Simpson.
Got a short in your taillight.

245
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,653
Started blinking
when you made that turn.

246
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:48,445
- Let's see your chauffeur's license.
- Chauffeur's license, eh?

247
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,090
Mel, buckle your borscht belt!

248
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:55,526
Since you're trying to make
a getaway in park...

249
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:57,808
...I'm guessing you don't
have a license.

250
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:00,727
Better head to the DMV.
These two broads'll help you out.

251
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:06,465
Wow. Officer, this man
is making me a little edgy.

252
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,861
- Could you give me a ride to the airport?
- Hey, hey! You're Mel Brooks!

253
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:13,043
- Sure, I'll give you a ride.
- Thank you.

254
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,137
On the way we can do that
2000-dollar-man thing.

255
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:19,888
You be Carl Reiner,
and I'll be Police Chief Wiggum.

256
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:23,680
Listen, why don't you play Carl Reiner,
and let me play Police Chief Wiggum.

257
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,425
I hate Carl Reiner!

258
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:32,635
I haven't been moved like this
since The Joy Luck Club.

259
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:40,286
They love me. I'm accepted.
I don 't need this mask anymore.

260
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:43,809
Behold! The masked dancer is me, Bart!

261
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,480
- It is I who have won your acclaim!
- Bart does ballet!

262
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:51,594
He dances like girls!

263
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:55,520
Go ahead and laugh. I took a chance
and did what I wanted to do.

264
00:16:55,688 --> 00:17:01,359
And if that makes me a sissy,
well, then, I guess I'm a sissy.

265
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:04,078
He's a sissy! Let's rush him!

266
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:06,024
- Yeah!
- Yeah, let's get him, come on!

267
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:09,480
After him! Go!

268
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:15,520
- There he is! There, right there!
- Bart, use the ballet. Leap!

269
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:19,581
Leap like you've never leapt before!

270
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,648
Looks like he took a pretty bad spill.

271
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,836
Well, as long as he's hurt.

272
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,207
Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV...

273
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,523
...where stupid Patty
and stupid Selma work.

274
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:44,583
Sometimes I think God is teasing me,
just like he teased Moses in the desert.

275
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:49,113
Tested, Homer. God tested Moses.
And try to be nice to my sisters.

276
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:51,529
It's very hard on me
to have you always fighting.

277
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,912
Oh, okay, Marge.
I'll get along with them.

278
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,590
Then I will hug some snakes.

279
00:17:55,757 --> 00:18:00,254
Yes! I will hug and kiss
some poisonous snakes!

280
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:01,663
Now, that's sarcasm.

281
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,355
Well, well, well.
Look who needs us again...

282
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:07,637
...to get his chauffeur's license.

283
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,717
Look, all I ask is that you be fair.

284
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:12,402
Did not adjust side mirror.
Minus one point.

285
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:14,650
Failed to check blind spot.
Minus two points.

286
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,100
You'll be happy when my
family thinks I'm a loser.

287
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:20,556
You are a loser, Homer!
And we're winners. You gotta learn that.

288
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,838
Seat belt twisted. Minus one point.

289
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:25,321
Nagging the driver.
Minus 10 points for you!

290
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:28,375
- Grazed a cone. Minus five.
- Being a jerk. Minus a million!

291
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:34,281
One more wrong answer, and Homer
flunks another of life's little tests.

292
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:36,596
And what's this?

293
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:39,147
Someone didn't fill in a circle
all the way.

294
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,892
- Oh, boy. Oh, that felt good.
- Let me try. Let me try.

295
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:51,361
Yeah. Oh, boy.
Oh, that was so sweet.

296
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:55,590
- So, Homer, how'd you do?
- Well, I...

297
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,657
Ladies, please don't tell me
you're smoking in a government building.

298
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:02,872
Because that is
the kind of infraction...

299
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,590
...that can cost a couple of sisters
their promotion.

300
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:07,536
- Well...
- What?

301
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,616
- You mean...
- Why...

302
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:12,939
Oh, you're talking about she...
Who's? What? She... What, this?

303
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:21,529
I'll never forgive myself for this.

304
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:26,529
Wait a minute. Those are yours, sir?

305
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:30,187
Yes. I am in flavor country.

306
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:33,811
- Both of them?
- It's a big country.

307
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:37,301
Ladies, I apologize.
And you, sir, are worse than Hitler.

308
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,935
Homer, I'm... I'm speechless.

309
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:45,686
- You just saved our hides.
- On top of everything else...

310
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:49,176
...don't make me picture your hides.
- It's a wonderful thing you did...

311
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,492
...for my sisters.
- I didn't do it for them.

312
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:54,948
I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you.

313
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:58,035
- Please ask me to kill for you.
- No, Homie.

314
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:02,129
You see? This is the stuff I've been
telling you about that you never see.

315
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:04,277
Homer.

316
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:07,834
We're... sorry.

317
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:10,384
- If there's anything we can do...
- Call off the debt?

318
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,136
Or, say, we could let you pass
your driver's test.

319
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:14,948
Call off the debt?

320
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:17,163
- Well...
- Debt's off! Let's go, Marge!
