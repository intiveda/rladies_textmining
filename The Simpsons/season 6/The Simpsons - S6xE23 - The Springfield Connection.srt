1
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:05,190
Springfield Connection

2
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:43,155
Aren't you glad we got out of the house
and came downtown for a little culture?

3
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:46,052
They're butchering the classics.

4
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:49,052
Could that bassoon have
come in any more late?

5
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:52,914
Oh, come on, Homer. There's lasers.
You like lasers.

6
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,879
Laser effects, mirrored balls...

7
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:57,845
...John Williams must be rolling
around in his grave.

8
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:06,500
Devil-iciously satirical.
I wonder if anyone else got that.

9
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:08,534
We're out of here!

10
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:15,190
Be careful. These are dangerous streets
for us upper-lower-middle-class types.

11
00:01:15,362 --> 00:01:20,362
So avoid eye contact, watch your
pocketbook, and suspect everyone.

12
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:22,707
- Three-card monte.
- Easy money!

13
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:24,569
Homer, these games are fixed.

14
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:26,845
Then how come that guy's winning?

15
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,155
I, like, totally won again.

16
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:31,121
Way to go, bro!

17
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:33,741
He looks and acts just like the dealer.

18
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:36,397
I think they're related,
or at least in cahoots.

19
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:39,776
Just pick the red card.
It's totally not hard.

20
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:44,914
Twenty on this one, my good man.

21
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:47,707
Sorry, dude. Black.

22
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:52,672
Homer, he cheated you!

23
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:54,914
You're giving three-car monte
a bad name!

24
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:57,190
Surely you don't blame me?

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,190
It's people like you who are ruining
our downtown promenades and piazzas.

26
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:04,328
How dare you prey on the greedy
and stupid like this!

27
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:07,086
- Bye-bye!
- Somebody stop him!

28
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:12,086
He's getting away!
Come on! Come on!

29
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:13,845
No, Marge!

30
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:45,879
I must warn you...

31
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:51,879
...sometimes ordinary people
get a surge of adrenaline.

32
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,293
- See?
- Cuff him, boys.

33
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,086
We're putting this dirtbag away.

34
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,914
I'll be back on the street in 24 hours.

35
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:06,121
We'll try to make it 12.

36
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:12,707
Marge, are you okay?

37
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:14,224
I think I'm okay.

38
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:18,155
It was scary, but in a weird way
it was also kind of exhilarating.

39
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:23,052
Yes. It is exhilarating to see police get
their man and save a hysterical woman.

40
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,500
Oh, for crying out loud.

41
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,948
Easy, now, sweetheart.
Homie's here.

42
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:33,052
Hey, Mom. Is this how you caught him?

43
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:36,155
Face it, Lis. You're too puny to...

44
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:40,086
Lisa, unhand your brother.

45
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,776
Yeah, like that really hurt.

46
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:51,390
Mom, was catching that guy the most
exciting thing you've ever done?

47
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:53,631
Well, it was pretty exciting.

48
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:58,010
But celery soup's pretty exciting too.

49
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:13,838
Strange. Regular ham
doesn't thrill me anymore.

50
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,252
I'm crossing over to deviled ham.

51
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:41,114
Marge!

52
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:44,907
Hey, Mrs. Simpson, I just got the new
issue of Sponge and Vacuum.

53
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:47,286
Thanks, Benevenstanciano.

54
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,700
Death sports.

55
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:06,493
All right, get in there.

56
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,010
- You're going down.
- I want a piece of him.

57
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:14,424
You think you're pretty hot, huh?
Well, we got everything we need on you.

58
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:17,355
- Excuse me.
- What? What? What?

59
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:19,941
What? What? What?
This better be about pizza.

60
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:23,493
Actually, I'm interested
in becoming a police officer.

61
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:39,872
Welcome aboard.

62
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,355
You did what?!

63
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:44,976
I borrowed your nail clipper.
What's the big deal?

64
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:48,597
Nothing. I'm just edgy since your mother
told me she wants to be a cop.

65
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,252
Cool! Will you bring me along
when you do evictions?

66
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:55,321
- You got it, little buddy.
- You being a cop makes you the man.

67
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,666
Which makes me the woman.
And I have no interest in that.

68
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:01,183
Besides occasionally
wearing the underwear...

69
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:04,079
...which, as we discussed,
is strictly a comfort thing.

70
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:07,534
Homer, there's no reason
for you to feel threatened.

71
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:10,466
You'll always be
the man of this house.

72
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,534
Thanks, honey.

73
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,293
All right, you scrawny beanpoles.

74
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:19,948
Becoming a cop is not something
that happens overnight.

75
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:23,121
It takes one solid weekend
of training to get that badge.

76
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:26,500
Forget about the badge!
When do we get the freaking guns?!

77
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:30,017
Hey, I told you, you don't get your gun
until you tell me your name.

78
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,914
I've had it up to here
with your "rules"!

79
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,914
Women always have trouble
with the wall.

80
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:53,534
They never seem to find the door.

81
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:14,431
You missed the baby.
You missed the blind man.

82
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,155
Oh. Sorry, Simpson.
You'll have to do the course again.

83
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,397
I was trying to get this
Magic Eye thing to work.

84
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,431
Look at that. A pony.

85
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:46,590
Hey, everybody! Mom's home.

86
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:53,176
They didn't have my size shirt,
but you get the idea.

87
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:58,314
Wow, Mom. I never pictured you
as any kind of authority figure before.

88
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,279
Marge, I want you to take care
of yourself out there.

89
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,831
You've become very dear to me.

90
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:05,693
Homie, of course I will.

91
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:09,693
Mom, if someone shot at the mayor,
would you have to take the bullet?

92
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,555
- I suppose I would.
- What about a Coke machine?

93
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:13,831
- No.
- TV?

94
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:16,210
- No.
- TV with a picture of the mayor on it?

95
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,486
Whatever you do,
we'll be proud of you.

96
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:22,038
- Well, thank you, honey.
- As long as it's constitutional.

97
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,590
Homer, give me my pepper spray!

98
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:28,900
Oh, Marge. One squirt
and you're south of the border.

99
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:33,624
Incapacitating.

100
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,900
All right, settle, people.
People, settle.

101
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,233
People. Ward and Van Zuylen,
stake out Doughnut Land.

102
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,500
When they fry up a fresh batch,
call it in.

103
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,333
Keneally and Earhart, back them up.

104
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,767
Fitz and Garcia,
it's your turn to sleep in.

105
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,100
And, Simpson...

106
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,100
...seeing how this is your first day...

107
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,467
...you're inexperienced
and vulnerable...

108
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,033
...your beat is Junkyville
and Bumtown.

109
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,167
Hello, Mr. Hutz.

110
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,233
I'll have you know the contents
of that dumpster are private.

111
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:15,267
You stick your nose in, you'll be violating
attorney-dumpster confidentiality.

112
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,133
I just wanted to say hello.

113
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,867
Hello.

114
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
You are the new cop on the beat?

115
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,333
Okay. I know the drill.

116
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
What will it be?
One hundred? Two hundred?

117
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,567
Two hundred. No, no. I mean, nothing.
I don't take bribes!

118
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,367
Yes, of course you don't.

119
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,067
I will just leave this money
on the table...

120
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:48,100
...with my unseeing back
to the money on the table.

121
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,633
Apu, no.

122
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,800
- That's better.
- That's better.

123
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,233
What are you gonna
do with your day off?

124
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,267
I just want to relax
and forget that I'm part...

125
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:05,767
...of that thin blue line which stands
between civilization and chaos.

126
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:13,200
It's illegal for you to operate that class-9
vehicle without pads and a helmet.

127
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,433
- But, Mom...
- It's for your own safety.

128
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,667
Take that, safety boy!

129
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,067
This padding's so easy on the knuckles,
I could punch all day!

130
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,917
I just hope they have
Us magazine in heaven.

131
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,150
He said it was his day
to use the tub pillow!

132
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,717
I can't go to the library anymore.
Everybody stinks.

133
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,517
Don't stop talking on account of me.
I may be a cop, but I'm still your friend.

134
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,850
So how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?

135
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:48,450
Law-abiding. I'm done.

136
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,450
Moe, I've never seen you here before.

137
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:58,750
Well, these days, my roots don't stay so
chestnut on their own, Officer Simpson.

138
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:02,250
You don't have to call me "officer."
I'm not on duty here.

139
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:03,683
Finished.

140
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,950
Looks nice. It's a good length for you.

141
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,183
Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad.

142
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,417
Shush, dear.
You'll wreck Daddy's fun.

143
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,217
Oh, my Lord!
Something horrible has happened!

144
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,617
Fooled you, Flanders.

145
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,483
Made you think your family was dead!

146
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,350
Did you get it?

147
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:45,850
They're not, though.

148
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:48,817
- But you thought they were.
- Yeah.

149
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:51,217
That's why it was so funny.

150
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,750
But they're not.

151
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:54,283
That's a good one.

152
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,583
And that's the drunk tank,
and this is Mommy's desk.

153
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,683
Mom, I know your intentions
are good.

154
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:03,483
But aren't police a force that maintains
the status quo for the wealthy elite?

155
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:05,983
Don't you think we should attack
social problems...

156
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,617
...instead of jamming
people into overcrowded prisons?

157
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,017
Look, Lisa!
It's McGriff the Crime Dog.

158
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:17,017
Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime.

159
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:23,917
Hey, great news, guys!
I picked up a nudie deck for our game.

160
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,983
"The girls of the Internet."

161
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,550
I'd go online with them any day.

162
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,383
Hey, hey! We've offended Herman.

163
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,983
No, I'm just going out
for some fresh air.

164
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,750
That guy sure likes his fresh air.

165
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,850
None of that for me.

166
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,017
Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah, yeah.

167
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,150
Homer, you sure it's okay to
smoke Cuban cigars and gamble...

168
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,583
...now that your wife's a cop?
- Are you kidding?

169
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,483
Being a cop husband
is one mighty sweet deal.

170
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,517
This police radio entertains me
with other people's miseries...

171
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:57,950
...we get a free funeral
for Marge, God forbid...

172
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:02,983
...and I can run background checks
on whomever I want, Momar.

173
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,583
Please, please.
Lx-nay on the Omar-may.

174
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,417
Hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've
got you clocked at two miles per hour.

175
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,717
Put that away.
Radar guns give you cancer.

176
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,750
All the more reason to hurry up.

177
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,917
Hey, what could be going
100 miles per...?

178
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,750
Illegal gambling in my house?

179
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,083
Your house? Your house?

180
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:29,983
Gee, it's so glamorously decorated,
I thought I was in Vegas.

181
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,717
Hey, you guys lied to me!
You said it was Vegas!

182
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:35,683
- We'll be going.
- We'll just be going. See you around.

183
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:38,483
Marge, you chased away
all my poker buddies.

184
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,983
I didn't mean to.

185
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,983
You've become such a cop.

186
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,483
Not that long ago,
you were so much more to me.

187
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:49,283
You were a cleaner of pots, a sewer
of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs.

188
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:51,150
I'm still all those things.

189
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:55,050
Only now I'm cleaning up the city,
sewing together the social fabric...

190
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:57,883
...and unplugging the clogs
of our legal system.

191
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,450
You're cooking what for dinner?

192
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,083
Everywhere I look,
someone is breaking the law.

193
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:09,350
Dog, no leash. Man littering.

194
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,350
Horse not wearing diaper.

195
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:16,517
Car parked across
three handicapped spaces.

196
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,683
- Homer!
- Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?

197
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,983
Homer, I'm on duty.

198
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,783
That's okay.
I'm supposed to be working too.

199
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,450
You have to move your car.

200
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,983
I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to
get some beer for those kids over there.

201
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,317
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
But you have to move your car now.

202
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:39,683
I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes
peeled for a real cop.

203
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,817
That's it!
I'm gonna write you a ticket!

204
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,483
- Come on! We're family!
- You're breaking the law!

205
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,883
I'll make you a deal.

206
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:49,450
You rip up that ticket
and I'll give you back your hat!

207
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,083
Homer, taking an officer's cap
is an arrestable offense.

208
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:01,317
What are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do, huh?

209
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,850
"I'm Officer Marge.
I'm gonna arrest you. " Whoa! What?

210
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,817
Marge, not here. Hey.

211
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,150
- You're not really arresting me?
- You have the right to remain silent.

212
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,250
I choose to waive that right.

213
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,383
All right, Simpson. You're free to go.

214
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:28,950
Let me just finish this last lobster tail
and raspberry torte.

215
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,750
All right, Hans. Time to go.

216
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,917
But he ate my last meal.

217
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,750
If that's the worst thing that happens
to you today, consider yourself lucky.

218
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:42,150
Are you really allowed to execute
people in a local jail?

219
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,917
From this point on, no talking.

220
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,617
I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer,
but what I did was right.

221
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:55,883
When you need it, you'll be happy there
are dedicated cops like me out there.

222
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,783
I have nothing more to say to you.

223
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,083
I'm drawing a line down the center
of the house, à la I Love Lucy.

224
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:04,383
You stay on your side
and I'll stay on my side.

225
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,283
Boy, when Marge first told me
she was going to the police academy...

226
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,950
...I thought it'd be fun and exciting.
You know, like that movie Spaceballs.

227
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:17,483
Instead it's been painful and disturbing,
like that movie Police Academy.

228
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,083
Hey, Homer.
I'm worried about the beer supply.

229
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:24,517
After this case, and the other case,
there's only one case left!

230
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,750
Yeah, yeah! Barney's right!

231
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,717
Yeah, let's drink some beer.

232
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:31,050
What about some beer?
Yeah, Barney's right.

233
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:34,650
All right, guys. Pipe down.
I got some more in the garage.

234
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:37,450
No. I'll get it for you, Homer.

235
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,183
I wonder why he's so eager
to go to the garage.

236
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,683
The garage. Hey, fellas! The garage.

237
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,383
Well, la-di-da, Mr. Frenchman.

238
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,617
- Well, what do you call it?
- A car hole.

239
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,217
- You're late, Herman.
- Surely you don't mind waiting...

240
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,617
...for merchandise of this quality,
Mr. Jericho?

241
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:04,450
Looks like good stuff. But, of course,
I'll have to sample it first.

242
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:07,183
These are fabulous!

243
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,617
Yeah. Who would suspect
that they're counterfeit jeans?

244
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:13,683
What better place to make the buy...

245
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,250
...than in a cop's garage,
where no one would suspect a thing?

246
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,350
Herman, I had to come out here
to see what's so funny.

247
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:29,383
A counterfeit-jeans ring operating
out of my car hole!

248
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,983
I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here.

249
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:33,717
Not so fast.

250
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,850
Okay.

251
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:40,750
Maybe you should just stop entirely.

252
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:42,917
Herman, how could you?

253
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,717
We've all thought
about counterfeiting jeans.

254
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:47,350
But what about the victims?

255
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:52,717
Hardworking designers like Calvin Klein,
Gloria Vanderbilt or Antoine Bugle Boy?

256
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:55,817
These are the people who saw
an overcrowded marketplace...

257
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,383
...and said, "Me too!"

258
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,283
Advance on him, men.

259
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:02,383
I don't think that's a very good idea.

260
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,383
Oh, no! It's Gloria Vanderbilt
out for revenge.

261
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,683
No, it's Officer Simpson of the police.

262
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:18,017
Herman, your beef is with me!
Leave the girl out of this!

263
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:20,717
- Okay.
- Homer!

264
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:24,350
It's too late for me, Marge!
Sell the jeans and live like a queen!

265
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:28,683
Is Bart home?

266
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,550
Just taking Maggie for a stroll.

267
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:37,917
I guess I am putting up
the Halloween decorations a little early.

268
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,683
Criticism accepted.

269
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,750
Marge!

270
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,050
- Go, Mom!
- Bust him! All right, Mom!

271
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:49,583
Go back to bed!
Don't make me come up there!

272
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:59,617
Looks like your wife
is embarking up the wrong tree.

273
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,350
Freeze! Every mother knows the secret
entrance to her son's tree house.

274
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:10,483
Oh, Marge, you saved my life.

275
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,617
I'm sorry I teased you.

276
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:16,550
You're a really good cop.
I'm proud of you.

277
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,117
So long. Gotta catch the 501.

278
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,650
- He's getting away! You blew it, Marge.
- I don't think so.

279
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,483
Foiled by my own
shoddy merchandise!

280
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:30,383
That's my ambulance!
I called for it four hours ago!

281
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,117
Marge, how did you know?

282
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,983
- That the pants would rip?
- No. What...

283
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:37,150
Years of buying pants for children
and a full-seated husband...

284
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,783
...has given me a sixth sense
for shoddy stitching...

285
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,650
...which these jeans have in spades.

286
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:45,017
That's nice work, Simpson, but we
can't hold him. There's no evidence.

287
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,283
There's a garage full
of counterfeit jeans.

288
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:50,617
They've mysteriously disappeared.

289
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:52,417
Looking good, boys.

290
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:56,983
That's it. There's too much
corruption on this force. I quit.

291
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:09,950
Sorry to lose you, Simpson.

292
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:14,450
I don't think they're coming back.

293
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,317
Well, that does it. That does it.
I'm looking at his cards.

294
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,017
Crap. I fold.
